 You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plants. 
 Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way, or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning, or that in the Himalaya, the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma, is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality, the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago. 
 And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives. 
 We're all born. We all bring our children into the world. 
 We go through initiation rites. 
 We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death, so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance, we all have art. 
 But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture. 
 And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo, or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti, or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya, the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes, or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma, Everest, the goddess mother of the world. 
 All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth. 
 And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope. 
 Now, together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet, and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere. 
 And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere, and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness. 
 The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy. 
 It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species. 
 And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded, so too is the ethnosphere -- and, if anything, at a far greater rate. 
 No biologists, for example, would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true, and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity. 
 And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss. 
 When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet. 
 Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules. 
 A language is a flash of the human spirit. 
 It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world. 
 Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind, a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities. 
 And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey, fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children. 
 They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effectively, unless something changes, they're already dead. 
 What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence, to be the last of your people to speak your language, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children? 
 And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks, some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue. 
 And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language?" And I say, "Great, let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese. 
 Let's make it Kogi." 
 And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language. 
 And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost. 
 Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "different ways of being," I really do mean different ways of being. 
 Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon, the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes. 
 Now, this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend. 
 They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called "linguistic exogamy:" you must marry someone who speaks a different language. 
 And this is all rooted in the mythological past, yet the curious thing is in these long houses, where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage, you never hear anyone practicing a language. 
 They simply listen and then begin to speak. 
 Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with, the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador, an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958. 
 In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake. 
 They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives. 
 They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure, found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death. 
 But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders. 
 They speared each other. 
 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other. 
 We traced genealogies back eight generations, and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it, they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. 
 But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing. 
 Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind. 
 In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies. 
 In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult. 
 On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview. 
 It's interesting. 
 If I asked you to name the great religions of the world, what would you say? 
 Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever. 
 There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era. 
 But, what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead. 
 So, the living give birth to the spirits. 
 The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water, responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god. 
 That's why the Voodooists like to say that "You white people go to church and speak about God. 
 We dance in the temple and become God." 
 And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed? 
 So you see these astonishing demonstrations: Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity, a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation. 
 Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia. 
 Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia, in the wake of the conquest, these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain. 
 In a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish. 
 To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary. 
 The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years: two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother. 
 And for this entire time, they are inculturated into the values of their society, values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance. 
 And at the end of this amazing initiation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back and says, "You see? It's really as I've told you. 
 It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect." 
 They call themselves the "elder brothers" and they say we, who are the younger brothers, are the ones responsible for destroying the world. 
 Now, this level of intuition becomes very important. 
 Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the "noble savage," which is an idea racist in its simplicity, or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are. 
 Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia. 
 There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless, through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it, but on a far subtler intuition: the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness. 
 Now, what does that mean? 
 It means that a young kid from the Andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined. 
 Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant. 
 What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world. 
 I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut. 
 That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world, spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation. 
 Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here. 
 It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April. 
 This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire. 
 What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources: on the one hand, this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines, harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis. 
 This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines, very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine. 
 If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses, that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine. 
 To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. 
 It doesn't create the distortion of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality. 
 In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s -- I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. 
 But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase. 
 They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO. 
 Now, the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question. 
 How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts? 
 Well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error," which is exposed to be meaningless. 
 But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us." 
 Well, what does that mean? 
 This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are referable to our eye as one species. 
 And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants. 
 I mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No." 
 Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key. 
 Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. 
 Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world, meaning our world, moves on. 
 Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations, but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change. 
 All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life. 
 And the problem is not technology itself. 
 The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy. 
 It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power, the crude face of domination. 
 Wherever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers, where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea, where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or, in the case of the Yanomami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold. 
 Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domination. 
 You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned, but ethnocide, the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned, it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated as part of a development strategy. 
 And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level. 
 I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about: 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes, 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution. 
 This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama. 
 That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion. 
 His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal. 
 His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy. 
 He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him. 
 The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp. 
 One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao, and for that transgression, she was given seven years of hard labor. 
 The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold. 
 And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice: do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity? 
 Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died, that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities. 
 And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps, been around for [150,000] years. 
 The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture, at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago. 
 The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old. 
 Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. 
 When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices. 
 And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism. 
 This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people, and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather. 
 The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s, to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements. 
 This old man's grandfather refused to go. 
 The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools. 
 Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold; they took advantage of it. 
 The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide. 
 So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing. 
 He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze, he shaped it into the form of a blade. 
 He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it. 
 He skinned the dog and improvised a harness, took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled, harnessed up an adjacent dog, and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt. 
 Talk about getting by with nothing. 
 And this, in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world. 
 The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together. 
 It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut. 
 It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources. 
 An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people. 
 And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all. 
 They're homelands of somebody. 
 They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geography of hope. 
 So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally, is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything. 
 We think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month. 
 156 nations carry our television channel. 
 Our magazines are read by millions. 
 And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore, embrace gradually, one by one, the central revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being. 
 Thank you very much. 
 What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. 
 We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through the thing, rearranging it in any way we want. 
 And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are. 
 Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel range. 
 It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. It's also very flexible architecture. 
 This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data. 
 This is "Bleak House" by Dickens. Every column is a chapter. 
 To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture. 
 Maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book. 
 I wouldn't recommend it. 
 This is a more realistic case. This is an issue of The Guardian. 
 Every large image is the beginning of a section. 
 And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium. 
 We've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian. 
 We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution -- much higher than you'd be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we've embedded extra content. 
 If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here. 
 Or other models, or even technical specifications. 
 And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate. 
 We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other kind of rubbish like that -- shouldn't be necessary. 
 Of course, mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this. 
 And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. 
 But those are all the roads in the U.S. 
 superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. 
 So let's pull up, now, something else. 
 This is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out. 
 This is a project called Photosynth, which really marries two different technologies. 
 One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. 
 and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. A very nice collaboration. 
 And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon. 
 You can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience. 
 But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. 
 The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- all these shots were taken. So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging, and these things have all been related spatially. 
 I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. 
 There are some that are much more spatial. 
 I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what I think is really the punch line behind this technology, the Photosynth technology. And it's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we've put up on the website. 
 We had to worry about the lawyers and so on. 
 This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr. You just type Notre Dame into Flickr, and you get some pictures of guys in t-shirts, and of the campus and so on. And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. 
 And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way. 
 And we can just navigate in this very simple way. 
 You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft. 
 It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here. 
 I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell phone cameras to professional SLRs, quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment. 
 And if I can, I'll find some of the sort of weird ones. 
 So many of them are occluded by faces, and so on. 
 Somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go. 
 This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. 
 We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment. 
 What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of, visually, of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together. 
 All of those photos become linked together, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. 
 You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. 
 Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work. 
 And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. 
 Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered. 
 If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data, and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space, into that meta-verse, using everybody else's photos, and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way. 
 And of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Do I understand this right? That what your software is going to allow, is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together? 
 Yes. What this is really doing is discovering. 
 It's creating hyperlinks, if you will, between images. 
 And it's doing that based on the content inside the images. 
 And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images have. 
 Like when you do a web search for images, you type in phrases, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. 
 Now, what if that picture links to all of your pictures? 
 Then the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really huge. It's a classic network effect. 
 Blaise, that is truly incredible. Congratulations. 
 Thanks so much. 
 I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard, and I'll try to make some connections myself, in case you miss them. 
 I want to start with what I call the "official dogma." 
 The official dogma of what? 
 The official dogma of all western industrial societies. 
 And the official dogma runs like this: if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens, the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom. 
 The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good, valuable, worthwhile, essential to being human. 
 And because if people have freedom, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare, and no one has to decide on our behalf. 
 The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice. 
 The more choice people have, the more freedom they have, and the more freedom they have, the more welfare they have. 
 This, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it. 
 And it's also deeply embedded in our lives. 
 I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us. 
 This is my supermarket. Not such a big one. 
 I want to say just a word about salad dressing. 
 175 salad dressings in my supermarket, if you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings, in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you. 
 So this is what the supermarket is like. 
 And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store, there are that many stereo systems. 
 We can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store. 
 You've got to admit that's a lot of choice. 
 In other domains -- the world of communications. 
 There was a time, when I was a boy, when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted, as long as it came from Ma Bell. 
 You rented your phone. You didn't buy it. 
 One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke. 
 And those days are gone. 
 We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones. 
 These are cell phones of the future. 
 My favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and creme brulee torch. 
 And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet, you can rest assured that one day soon you will. 
 And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question. 
 And do you know what the answer to this question now is? 
 The answer is "No." 
 It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much. 
 So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things, the same explosion of choice is true. 
 Health care -- it is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do. 
 Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B. 
 A has these benefits, and these risks. 
 B has these benefits, and these risks. What do you want to do?" 
 And you say, "Doc, what should I do?" 
 And the doc says, "A has these benefits and risks, and B has these benefits and risks. 
 What do you want to do?" 
 And you say, "If you were me, Doc, what would you do?" 
 And the doc says, "But I'm not you." 
 And the result is -- we call it "patient autonomy," which makes it sound like a good thing, but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely, the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely, the patient. 
 There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me, which, if you think about it, makes no sense at all, since we can't buy them. 
 Why do they market to us if we can't buy them? 
 The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed. 
 Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice, as this slide is meant to indicate. 
 We don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it. 
 And we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like. 
 And that means that everyday, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. 
 With respect to marriage and family, there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could, and then you started having kids as soon as you could. 
 The only real choice was who, not when, and not what you did after. 
 Nowadays, everything is very much up for grabs. 
 I teach wonderfully intelligent students, and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to. 
 And it's not because they're less smart, and it's not because they're less diligent. 
 It's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves, "Should I get married or not? Should I get married now? 
 Should I get married later? Should I have kids first, or a career first?" 
 All of these are consuming questions. 
 And they're going to answer these questions, whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses. 
 And indeed they should. These are important questions to answer. 
 Work -- we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out, with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the Randolph Hotel. 
 There is one corner, by the way, that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi works. 
 I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it. 
 So what this means, this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work, is that we have to make a decision, again and again and again, about whether we should or shouldn't be working. 
 We can go to watch our kid play soccer, and we have our cell phone on one hip, and our Blackberry on our other hip, and our laptop, presumably, on our laps. 
 And even if they're all shut off, every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game, we are also asking ourselves, "Should I answer this cell phone call? 
 Should I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?" 
 And even if the answer to the question is "no," it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been. 
 So everywhere we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things, life is a matter of choice. 
 And the world we used to live in looked like this. 
 That is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice. 
 And the world we now live in looks like this. 
 And the question is, is this good news, or bad news? 
 And the answer is yes. 
 We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. 
 All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people. 
 One effect, paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation. 
 With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all. 
 I'll give you one very dramatic example of this: a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans. 
 A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard, the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces. 
 And what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered, rate of participation went down two percent. 
 You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. Why? 
 Because with 50 funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow. 
 And then tomorrow, and then tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and of course tomorrow never comes. 
 Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer. 
 By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer, who would happily match their contribution. 
 So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices. 
 And I think it makes the world look like this. 
 You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right? 
 You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or even the wrong salad dressing. 
 So that's one effect. The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. 
 And there are several reasons for this. 
 One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and, you know, what salad dressing is? -- it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made, and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made, even if it was a good decision. 
 The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose. 
 Second, what economists call "opportunity costs." 
 Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to. 
 Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject, that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen. 
 Here's an example. For those of you who aren't New Yorkers, I apologize. 
 But here's what you're supposed to be thinking. 
 Here's this couple on the Hamptons. 
 Very expensive real estate. 
 Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves. 
 What could be better? "Well, damn it," this guy is thinking, "It's August. 
 Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away. 
 I could be parking right in front of my building." 
 And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space. 
 Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose, even when what we choose is terrific. 
 And the more options there are to consider, the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs. 
 Here's another example. 
 Now this cartoon makes a lot of points. 
 It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slowly. 
 But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing, you're choosing not to do other things. 
 And those other things may have lots of attractive features, and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive. 
 Third: escalation of expectations. 
 This hit me when I went to replace my jeans. 
 I wear jeans almost all the time. 
 And there was a time when jeans came in one flavor, and you bought them, and they fit like crap, and they were incredibly uncomfortable, and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times, they started to feel OK. 
 So I went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones, and I said, you know, "I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size." 
 And the shopkeeper said, "Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit? 
 You want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid-washed? 
 Do you want them distressed? 
 You want boot cut, you want tapered, blah blah blah ..." On and on he went. 
 My jaw dropped, and after I recovered, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kind." 
 He had no idea what that was, so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans, and I walked out of the store -- truth! -- with the best-fitting jeans I had ever had. 
 I did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better. 
 But I felt worse. 
 Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself. 
 The reason I felt worse is that, with all of these options available, my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up. 
 I had very low -- I had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor. 
 When they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect. 
 And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect. 
 And so I compared what I got to what I expected, and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected. 
 Adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be. 
 And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results, even when they're good results. 
 Nobody in the world of marketing knows this, because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about. 
 The truth is more like this. 
 The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise. 
 Nowadays, the world we live in -- we affluent, industrialized citizens, with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. 
 You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof. 
 The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations. 
 I want to say -- just a little autobiographical moment -- that I actually am married to a wife, and she's really quite wonderful. 
 I couldn't have done better. I didn't settle. 
 But settling isn't always such a bad thing. 
 Finally, one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied, and you ask why, who's responsible, the answer is clear: the world is responsible. What could you do? 
 When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available, and you buy one that is disappointing, and you ask why, who's responsible? 
 It is equally clear that the answer to the question is you. 
 You could have done better. 
 With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display, there is no excuse for failure. 
 And so when people make decisions, and even though the results of the decisions are good, they feel disappointed about them; they blame themselves. 
 Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. 
 I believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression, and also suicide, is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high, and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think they're at fault. 
 And so the net result is that we do better in general, objectively, and we feel worse. 
 So let me remind you. 
 This is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true, and it's all false. It is not true. 
 There's no question that some choice is better than none, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. 
 There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is. 
 I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare. 
 Now, as a policy matter -- I'm almost done -- as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this: what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence. 
 There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice. 
 Their problem is that they have too little. 
 So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern, affluent, Western societies. 
 And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this: Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don't help. It's a waste of money. 
 What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices -- it's not simply that they don't help. 
 They actually hurt. 
 They actually make us worse off. 
 If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options, not only would those people's lives be improved, but ours would be improved also. 
 This is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move." 
 Income redistribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this excess choice plagues us. 
 So to conclude. You're supposed to read this cartoon, and, being a sophisticated person, say, "Ah! What does this fish know? 
 You know, nothing is possible in this fishbowl." 
 Impoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world -- and that's the way I read it at first. 
 The more I thought about it, however, the more I came to the view that this fish knows something. 
 Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom. You have paralysis. 
 If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible, you decrease satisfaction. 
 You increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction. 
 Everybody needs a fishbowl. 
 This one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us. 
 But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery, and, I suspect, disaster. 
 Thank you very much. 
 You know, I've talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean, and discovering new sets of genes. 
 We're actually starting at a new point: we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. 
 So, we've always been trying to ask big questions. 
 "What is life?" is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels. 
 We've tried various approaches, paring it down to minimal components. 
 We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years; when we sequenced the human genome, it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer. 
 Now we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe?" 
 This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome. 
 We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here. 
 When we look at its metabolic map, it's relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me, this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time, it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell. 
 So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions. 
 And so we started down the road of: can we synthesize a chromosome? 
 Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before? 
 And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome? 
 A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material. 
 So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace. 
 Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing, and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve. 
 We started this over 15 years ago. 
 It took several stages, in fact, starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments. 
 But it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult. 
 There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are. 
 So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors. 
 And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information of the genome of phi X174. 
 It's a small virus that kills bacteria. 
 We designed the pieces, went through our error correction and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters. 
 The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria, and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, made the viral particles. 
 The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli. 
 I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model. 
 They laughed more than you guys are. 
 And so, we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system. 
 But we wanted to go much larger: we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are. 
 Design is critical, and if you're starting with digital information in the computer, that digital information has to be really accurate. 
 When we first sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs. 
 We actually found, on resequencing it, 30 errors; had we used that original sequence, it never would have been able to be booted up. 
 Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together. 
 We design unique elements into this. 
 You may have read that we put watermarks in. 
 Think of this: we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T. 
 Triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids, such that there's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids. 
 So we can use the genetic code to write out words, sentences, thoughts. 
 Initially, all we did was autograph it. 
 Some people were disappointed there was not poetry. 
 We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together. 
 And we started making pieces, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters, put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces, then put sets of those going up to 72,000. 
 At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute. 
 We're trying to get to the point of automation. 
 So, this looks like a basketball playoff. 
 When we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs, they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli -- it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms. 
 We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together. 
 Here's an example of it: there's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation. 
 You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart. 
 Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was before. 
 We have thousands of organisms that can do this. 
 These organisms can be totally desiccated; they can live in a vacuum. 
 I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space, move around, find a new aqueous environment. 
 In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there. 
 Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in; yeast puts them together automatically. 
 This is not an electron micrograph; this is just a regular photomicrograph. 
 It's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope. 
 These are pictures over about a six-second period. 
 So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago. 
 This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code; it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure. 
 It's over 300 million molecular weight. 
 If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing, it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code. 
 Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this? 
 Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple; it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria. 
 It's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves: you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with cloning. 
 With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. 
 We purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome, we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins, and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here. 
 The new chromosome went into the cell. 
 In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went, but we tried to design the process a little bit further. 
 This is a major mechanism of evolution right here. 
 We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere, adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species. 
 So, people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology. 
 There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA. 
 The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one; the chromosome we put in does. 
 It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material, chewed it up, and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome. 
 It turned blue because of the genes we put in it. 
 And with a very short period of time, all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell. 
 All the proteins changed, the membranes changed; when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in. 
 So, this may sound like genomic alchemy, but we can, by moving the software of DNA around, change things quite dramatically. 
 Now I've argued, this is not genesis; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. 
 And I've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion, where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design. 
 Why do this? 
 I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs. 
 We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years. 
 To put it in context for myself: I was born in 1946. 
 There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946; within 40 years, there'll be four. 
 We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water, medicines, fuel for the six and a half billion. 
 It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine. 
 We use over five billion tons of coal, 30 billion-plus barrels of oil -- that's a hundred million barrels a day. 
 When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that, it's going to be a huge challenge. 
 Then of course, there's all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere. 
 We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the future. 
 The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components, and look at the diversity that came out of that. 
 We're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination. 
 We now have techniques, because of these rapid methods of synthesis, to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics. 
 We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day. 
 When you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals, new vaccines, we can just with a small team, do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science. 
 And it's just standard selection: we can select for viability, chemical or fuel production, vaccine production, etc. 
 This is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer. 
 You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like: we know exactly what their genetic code looks like. 
 We're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels. 
 You've seen recently, corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment. 
 We have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol. 
 But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock, and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road. 
 And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months. 
 Sunlight and CO2 is one method ... 
 but in our discovery around the world, we have all kinds of other methods. 
 This is an organism we described in 1996. 
 It lives in the deep ocean, about a mile and a half deep, almost at boiling-water temperatures. 
 It takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source. 
 We're looking to see if we can take captured CO2, which can easily be piped to sites, convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process. 
 So, in a short period of time, we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of "What is life?" 
 We truly, you know, have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry -- Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? -- become a major source of energy ... 
 But also, we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines. 
 You've seen this year with flu; we're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine. 
 I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance. 
 Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing, now, the evolutionary tree, speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria, Archaea and, eventually, eukaryotes. 
 We're a ways away from improving people: our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much. 
 Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC. 
 And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked. 
 So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference. 
 Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began, up to 600 million times a second. 
 It's nothing if not ambitious. 
 This is the machine below Geneva. 
 We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors. 
 This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter. 
 Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale. 
 On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time. 
 And this picture was taken by ATLAS. 
 It caused immense celebration in the control room. 
 It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC, colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately, and showering particles into the detector. 
 In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked, which is a great triumph. 
 I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer, or this, when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that. 
 It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact. 
 About a week later we had a problem with the machine, related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires. 
 Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power. 
 Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say, "No they don't. They're small wires." 
 They can do that because when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire. 
 So at minus 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, those wires can take that current. 
 In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect. 
 So the wire heated up slightly, and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance. 
 This was the result. 
 Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons, and they moved about a foot. 
 So we damaged about 50 of the magnets. 
 We had to take them out, which we did. 
 We reconditioned them all, fixed them. 
 They're all on their way back underground now. 
 By the end of March the LHC will be intact again. 
 We will switch it on, and we expect to take data in June or July, and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are. 
 Now of course, in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute. 
 I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC. 
 I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy, who, I suspect, when defending his protege's useless experiments -- his protege was Michael Faraday -- said this, "Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate, that there are no mysteries in nature, that our triumphs are complete, and that there are no new worlds to conquer." 
 Thank you. 
 I am a writer. 
 Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course. 
 It is also my great lifelong love and fascination. 
 And I don't expect that that's ever going to change. 
 But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career, which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work. 
 And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book, this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love" which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books, went out in the world for some reason, and became this big, mega-sensation, international bestseller thing. 
 The result of which is that everywhere I go now, people treat me like I'm doomed. 
 Seriously -- doomed, doomed! 
 Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say, "Aren't you afraid -- aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that? 
 Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all, ever again?" 
 So that's reassuring, you know. 
 But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I first started telling people -- when I was a teenager -- that I wanted to be a writer, I was met with this same kind of, sort of fear-based reaction. 
 And people would say, "Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success? 
 Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you? 
 Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?" 
 Like that, you know. 
 The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes." 
 Yes, I'm afraid of all those things. 
 And I always have been. 
 And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides that people can't even guess at. 
 Like seaweed, and other things that are scary. 
 But, when it comes to writing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately, is why? 
 You know, is it rational? 
 Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do. 
 You know, and what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know? 
 Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know? 
 It didn't -- that chemical engineering block John, how's it going? 
 It just didn't come up like that, you know? 
 But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives. 
 We writers, we kind of do have that reputation, and not just writers, but creative people across all genres, it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable. 
 And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands, you know? 
 And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know. 
 Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said "Every one of my books has killed me a little more." 
 An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work, you know. 
 But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish. 
 And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea? 
 Are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know -- I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption. 
 I think it's odious. 
 And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century. 
 I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live. 
 And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption, particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career. 
 Which is -- you know, like check it out, I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old. 
 I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me. 
 And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book, right? 
 I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now -- it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me. 
 Oh, so Jesus, what a thought! 
 You know that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning, and I don't want to go there. 
 I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love. 
 And so, the question becomes, how? 
 And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing, is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right? 
 I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on. 
 And, as I've been looking over the last year for models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people, sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity. 
 And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome. 
 So stay with me, because it does circle around and back. 
 But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then, O.K.? 
 People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons. 
 The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons." 
 Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar. 
 The Romans had the same idea, but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius. 
 Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual. 
 They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work. 
 So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work. 
 And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right? 
 So the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like, for example, too much narcissism, right? 
 If your work was brilliant you couldn't take all the credit for it, everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you. 
 If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know? 
 Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame. 
 And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time. 
 And then the Renaissance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries, and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine. 
 And it's the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual. 
 And for the first time in history, you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius. 
 And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error. 
 You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche. 
 It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun. 
 It just completely warps and distorts egos, and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance. 
 And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years. 
 And, if this is true, and I think it is true, the question becomes, what now? 
 Can we do this differently? 
 Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery. 
 Maybe not. 
 Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech. 
 And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of, basically fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff. 
 I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this. 
 But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know, why not? 
 Why not think about it this way? 
 Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process. 
 A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally. 
 And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal. 
 I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone, who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia, she would be out working in the fields, and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape. 
 And she said it was like a thunderous train of air. 
 And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape. 
 And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet. 
 She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, "run like hell." 
 And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem, and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page. 
 And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she'd be running and running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape, looking, as she put it "for another poet." 
 And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right? 
 So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her, and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it. 
 She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page. 
 And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards, from the last word to the first. 
 So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like. 
 That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline! 
 I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly. 
 But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times. 
 And I would imagine that a lot of you have too. 
 You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify. 
 And what is that thing? 
 And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but, in fact, might actually keep us sane? 
 And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits, who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment. 
 And we were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized. 
 But then he got older, he got calmer, and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me, and this is when it all changed for him. 
 And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody, that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing, and he wants it, you know, it's gorgeous, and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it. 
 He doesn't have a piece of paper, he doesn't have a pencil, he doesn't have a tape recorder. 
 So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like, "I'm going to lose this thing, and then I'm going to be haunted by this song forever. 
 I'm not good enough, and I can't do it." 
 And instead of panicking, he just stopped. 
 He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel. 
 He just looked up at the sky, and he said, "Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?" 
 "Do I look like I can write down a song right now? 
 If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you. 
 Otherwise, go bother somebody else today. 
 Go bother Leonard Cohen." 
 And his whole work process changed after that. 
 Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever. 
 But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it kind of back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing. 
 It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite Tom. 
 So when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and it already saved me once. 
 This idea, it saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love," and I fell into one of those, sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, this is going to be the worst book ever written. 
 Not just bad, but the worst book ever written. 
 And I started to think I should just dump this project. 
 But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it. 
 So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room. 
 And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault, right? 
 Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this. 
 So if you want it to be better, then you've got to show up and do your part of the deal. 
 O.K. But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it. 
 I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job. 
 And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job." 
 Because -- in the end it's like this, O.K. -- centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa, people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn. 
 And they were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific, right? 
 But every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen, and one of these performers would actually become transcendent. 
 And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this. 
 It was like time would stop, and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would align. 
 And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human. 
 He would be lit from within, and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity. 
 And when this happened, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name. 
 They would put their hands together and they would start to chant, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God." 
 That's God, you know. 
 Curious historical footnote -- when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Ole, ole, ole," which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances. 
 In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic, "Allah, ole, ole, Allah, magnificent, bravo," incomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God. 
 Which is great, because we need that. 
 But, the tricky bit comes the next morning, for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God. 
 He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees, and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again. 
 And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life? 
 This is hard. 
 This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life. 
 But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe, in the first place, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you. 
 But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else. 
 And, you know, if we think about it this way it starts to change everything. 
 This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published, as the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success. 
 And what I have to, sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that, is, don't be afraid. 
 Don't be daunted. 
 Just do your job. 
 Continue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be. 
 If your job is to dance, do your dance. 
 If the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed, for just one moment through your efforts, then "Ole!" 
 And if not, do your dance anyhow. 
 And "Ole!" to you, nonetheless. 
 I believe this and I feel that we must teach it. 
 "Ole!" to you, nonetheless, just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Ole! 
 Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap, which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states, has shrunk by 40 percent. 
 But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice. 
 The arctic ice cap is, in a sense, the beating heart of the global climate system. 
 It expands in winter and contracts in summer. 
 The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years. 
 The permanent ice is marked in red. 
 As you see, it expands to the dark blue -- that's the annual ice in winter, and it contracts in summer. 
 The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older, you can see is almost like blood, spilling out of the body here. 
 In 25 years it's gone from this, to this. 
 This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean, where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes. 
 Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, that amount could double if we cross this tipping point. 
 Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska, methane is actively bubbling up out of the water. 
 Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter. 
 Whoa! 
 She's okay. The question is whether we will be. 
 And one reason is, this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north. 
 This is an annual melting river. 
 But the volumes are much larger than ever. 
 This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland. 
 If you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea. 
 These flows are increasing very rapidly. 
 At the other end of the planet, Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet. 
 Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance. 
 And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands, is particularly rapid in its melting. 
 That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland. 
 In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice: at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers. 
 40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow. 
 In the Andes, this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city. 
 The flows have increased. 
 But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water. 
 In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack. 
 This is hitting the reservoirs. 
 And the predictions, as you've read, are serious. 
 This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires. 
 And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate. 
 Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75. 
 This is a completely unsustainable pattern. 
 If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing. 
 In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans. 
 Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific, from the Americas, extending westward, and on either side of the Indian subcontinent, where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans. 
 The biggest single cause of global warming, along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels. 
 Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem. 
 The United States is one of the two largest emitters, along with China. 
 And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. 
 But we're beginning to see a sea change. 
 Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed. 
 However there is a political battle in our country. 
 And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal, which is an oxymoron. 
 That image reminded me of something. 
 Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee, a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled. 
 You probably saw it on the news. 
 This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America. 
 This happened around Christmas. 
 One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one. 
 Frosty the coal man is a jolly, happy soul. 
 He's abundant here in America, and he helps our economy grow. 
 Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday. 
 He's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay. 
 This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia. 
 The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal. 
 Let me be clear about it. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about. 
 So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns. 
 This is one of them, part of one of them. 
 At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business. 
 That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal. 
 The fact is, coal isn't dirty. 
 We think it's clean -- smells good, too. 
 So don't worry about climate change. 
 Leave that up to us. 
 Clean coal -- you've heard a lot about it. 
 So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility. 
 Amazing! The machinery is kind of loud. 
 But that's the sound of clean coal technology. 
 And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming, the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything. 
 Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology. 
 Finally, the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge. 
 America is in crisis -- the economy, national security, the climate crisis. 
 The thread that links them all: our addiction to carbon based fuels, like dirty coal and foreign oil. 
 But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess. 
 Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years. 
 A plan to put America back to work, make us more secure, and help stop global warming. 
 Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems. 
 Repower America. Find out more. 
 This is the last one. 
 It's about repowering America. 
 One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet. 
 Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid. 
 New investments to create high-paying jobs. 
 Repower America. It's time to get real. 
 There is an old African proverb that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone. 
 If you want to go far, go together." 
 We need to go far, quickly. 
 Thank you very much. 
 I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid, playing with blocks. 
 As you figured out how to reach out and grasp, pick them up and move them around, you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships. 
 Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us. 
 So, as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer, instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop, what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically, arranging it the way we wanted? 
 This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer, by building Siftables. 
 In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie. 
 They're able to be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, they can sense their motion, and they have a screen and a wireless radio. 
 Most importantly, they're physical, so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping. 
 And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information. 
 And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles. 
 So, I'm going to start with some simple examples. 
 This Siftable is configured to show video, and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards. 
 And these interactive portraits are aware of each other. 
 So if I put them next to each other, they get interested. 
 If they get surrounded, they notice that too, they might get a little flustered. 
 And they can also sense their motion and tilt. 
 One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize, was that we could use everyday gestures on data, like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid. 
 So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one, where they get mixed. 
 If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back. 
 There are also some neat possibilities for education, like language, math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly, and view the results immediately. 
 So here I'm -- This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program. 
 Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle. 
 Basically, in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable, and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary. 
 Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try. 
 Thank you. 
 So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab, and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video. 
 They really loved it. 
 And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. 
 All you have to say is, "Make words," and they know exactly what to do. 
 So here's another few people trying it out. 
 That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right. 
 Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up. 
 So to him, they were just blocks. 
 Now, this is an interactive cartoon application. 
 And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners. 
 And this is Felix, actually. 
 And he can bring new characters into the scene, just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them. 
 Here, he's bringing the sun out. 
 The sun is rising. 
 Now he's brought a tractor into the scene. 
 The orange tractor. 
 Good job! Yeah! 
 So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Woof! 
 inventing his own narrative. 
 Hello! 
 It's an open-ended story, and he gets to decide how it unfolds. 
 Fly away, cat. 
 So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently, in which Siftables act as sounds like lead, bass and drums. 
 Each of these has four different variations, you get to choose which one you want to use. 
 And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want. 
 And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable. 
 There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter. 
 You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it. 
 And then, overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence. 
 So let's have a look. 
 We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series, extend it, add a little more lead. 
 Now I put a bass line in. 
 Now I'll put some percussion in. 
 And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live. 
 I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other. 
 And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression. 
 I can rearrange the sequence while it plays. 
 So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise, making it longer or shorter as I go. 
 And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left. 
 Thank you. 
 So, as you can see, my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work. 
 And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory. 
 So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms. 
 Thank you very much. 
 I look forward to talking with all of you. 
 How would you like to be better than you are? 
 Suppose I said that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could get a better memory -- more precise, more accurate and quicker. 
 Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger, with more stamina. 
 Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident? 
 How about living longer with good health? 
 Or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity. 
 Which one would you like the most? 
 Which would you like, if you could have just one? 
 Creativity. 
 How many people would choose creativity? 
 Raise your hands. Let me see. 
 A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here. 
 That's very good. 
 How many would opt for memory? 
 Quite a few more. 
 How about fitness? 
 A few less. 
 What about longevity? 
 Ah, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor. 
 If you could have any one of these, it would be a very different world. 
 Is it just imaginary? 
 Or, is it, perhaps, possible? 
 Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject. 
 The great 20th-century geneticist, T.G. Dobzhansky, who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church, once wrote an essay that he titled "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution." 
 Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid, take out your personal communications device -- I give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong, because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you. 
 But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this: is it just about the past, or is it about the future? 
 Does it apply to others, or does it apply to us? 
 This is another look at the tree of life. 
 In this picture, I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions, because if you look at the edges of the tree of life, every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms: it has survived; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment. 
 The human part of this branch, way out on one end, is, of course, the one that we are most interested in. 
 We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago. 
 In the interval, there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids. 
 Some have come and gone. 
 We have been here for about 130,000 years. 
 It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, for the most part, the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same. 
 Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics? 
 This is not like human insulin; this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas. 
 And speaking of bacteria, do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body? 
 Maybe 10 times more. 
 I mean think of it, when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image, do you think about the bacteria? 
 Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria. 
 It's warm, it's dark, it's moist, it's very cozy. 
 And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part. 
 It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria, with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit. 
 But otherwise, you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria, just as they are essential to your life. 
 They help in the digestion of essential nutrients, and they protect you against certain diseases. 
 But what will come in the future? 
 Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species? 
 Or, are we destined to become something different -- something, perhaps, even better adapted to the environment? 
 Now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago -- the Earth, the solar system, about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of proto-life, maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth -- the first multi-celled organisms, perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species, finally emerging in the last 130,000 years. 
 In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief measure; the animal kingdom, like a single measure; and human life, a small grace note. 
 That was us. 
 That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk, so I hope you enjoyed it. 
 Now when I was a freshman in college, I took my first biology class. 
 I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology. 
 I became enamored of the power of evolution, and I realized something very fundamental: in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms, each cell simply divides, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells. 
 But at the time multi-celled organisms come online, things start to change. 
 Sexual reproduction enters the picture. 
 And very importantly, with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome, the rest of the body becomes expendable. 
 In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction. 
 Now I have to confess, when I was a college undergraduate, I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with each passing year, I've come to have increasing doubts. 
 I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns, who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s. 
 And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door. 
 He answers the door. 
 Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl. 
 She looks at him and says, "I'm here for super sex." 
 "That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup." 
 I came to realize, as a physician, that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory, just different. 
 I was trying to preserve the body. 
 I wanted to keep us healthy. 
 I wanted to restore health from disease. 
 I wanted us to live long and healthy lives. 
 Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation, adapting and surviving through generation after generation. 
 From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea. 
 I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. 
 I want to achieve it through not dying." 
 Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived. 
 It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest, and not even the smartest. 
 Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment. 
 That is the sole test of survival and success. 
 At the bottom of the ocean, bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce, if fish were there, sous-vide cooked fish, nevertheless, have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them. 
 So what does this mean, as we look back at what has happened in evolution, and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution, and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase, I would say that there are a number of possibilities. 
 The first is that we will not evolve. 
 We have reached a kind of equipoise. 
 And the reasoning behind that would be, first, we have, through medicine, managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population. 
 And secondly, we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it. 
 And by the way, we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place. 
 A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind, natural, imposed by the forces of nature. 
 And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly, but they are inexorable. 
 And as far as isolation goes, when we as a species do colonize distant planets, there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way. 
 But there's a third possibility, an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility. 
 I call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural, but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make. 
 Now how could this come about? 
 How could it be possible that we would do this? 
 Consider, first, the reality that people today, in some cultures, are making choices about their offspring. 
 They're, in some cultures, choosing to have more males than females. 
 It's not necessarily good for the society, but it's what the individual and the family are choosing. 
 Think also, if it were possible ever for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child, but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases. 
 What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke? 
 Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes? 
 If we look ahead, these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible. 
 The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and it took 13 years. 
 It cost 2.7 billion dollars. 
 The year after it was finished in 2004, you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months. 
 Today, you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week. 
 It won't be very long before the reality will be the 1,000-dollar human genome, and it will be increasingly available for everyone. 
 Just a week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer, two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution." 
 A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell, a fibroblast, and by manipulating just four genes, he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body. 
 These changes are coming. 
 The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves, but induce immunity against other viruses. 
 Believe it or not, there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant. 
 Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco? 
 These are all reality today, and [in] the future, will be evermore possible. 
 Imagine then just two other little changes. 
 You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells in your offspring? 
 What if you could change the sperm and the ova, or change the newly fertilized egg, and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia, reduce the risk of cancer? 
 Who doesn't want healthier children? 
 And then, that same analytic technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease, will also enable us to adopt super-attributes, hyper-capacities -- that better memory. 
 Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings, especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine? 
 Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer? 
 Why not live longer? 
 These will be irresistible. 
 And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes we want, we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution. 
 We'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years, and we can compress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years. 
 These are choices that your grandchildren, or their grandchildren, are going to have before them. 
 Will we use these choices to make a society that is better, that is more successful, that is kinder? 
 Or, will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us? 
 Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform, or more robust and more versatile? 
 These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face. 
 And most profoundly of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom, and to inherit the wisdom, that we'll need to make these choices wisely? 
 For better or worse, and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us. 
 Thank you. 
 I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities, or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again. 
 We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons. 
 These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning, and it will give you extra strength, and it will further enhance your speed, and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance. 
 It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine. 
 But not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there. 
 This is just not some blue sky thinking. 
 To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier, that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs, and they are being asked to carry more equipment. 
 Obviously, this is resulting in some major complications -- back injuries, 30 percent of them -- chronic back injuries. 
 So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue. 
 So let me now introduce to you HULC -- or the Human Universal Load Carrier. 
 With the HULC exoskeleton, I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain for many hours. 
 Its flexible design allows for deep squats, crawls and high-agility movements. 
 It senses what I want to do, where I want to go, and then augments my strength and endurance. 
 We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device, this new exoskeleton this year. 
 So this is for real. 
 Now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users, something that I'm particularly passionate about. 
 There are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide. 
 This is about one percent of the total population. 
 And that's actually a conservative estimate. 
 We are talking here about, oftentimes, very young individuals with spinal cord injuries, that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s -- hit a wall and the wheelchair's the only option. 
 But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers. 
 And the only option, pretty much -- when it's stroke or other complications -- is the wheelchair. 
 And that is actually for the last 500 years, since its very successful introduction, I must say. 
 So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility. 
 Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured, and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now. 
 Thank you. 
 Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set. 
 It has sensors. 
 It's completely non-invasive, sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back. 
 There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips, as well as her knee joints, that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait. 
 I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me. 
 In a split second, I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis. 
 Not long afterwards, a doctor strode into my hospital room, and he said, "Amanda, you'll never walk again." 
 And that was 19 yeas ago. 
 He robbed every ounce of hope from my being. 
 Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again, to rock climb and even handcycle. 
 But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk, until now. 
 Thank you. 
 As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you. 
 It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers, or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users, but for everyone. 
 Thanks. 
 Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood. 
 When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company. 
 Now in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action. 
 I remember my first fire. 
 I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in. 
 But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be. 
 When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life. 
 Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the pouring rain, under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house was in flames. 
 The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let's call him Lex Luther -- got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. 
 The dog! I was stunned with jealousy. 
 Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds. 
 Well, I was next. 
 The captain waved me over. 
 He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house. 
 I need you to go upstairs, past the fire, and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes." 
 I swear. 
 So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went -- up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point, into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes. 
 Now I know what you're thinking, but I'm no hero. 
 I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door. 
 We took our treasures outside to the homeowner, where, not surprisingly, his received much more attention than did mine. 
 A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home. 
 The act of kindness she noted above all others: someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes. 
 In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis. 
 And you know what I've learned? 
 They all matter. 
 So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved, or are on their way to achieving, remarkable levels of success, I would offer this reminder: don't wait. 
 Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life. 
 If you have something to give, give it now. 
 Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park. 
 Be a mentor. 
 Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one. 
 So get in the game. Save the shoes. 
 Thank you. 
 Mark, Mark, come back. 
 Thank you. 
 I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival. 
 It's a place where women run the show, have sex to say hello, and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business. 
 And no, this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins. 
 This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo. 
 Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your living closest relative. 
 That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived around six million years ago. 
 Now, chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression. 
 But unfortunately, we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution. 
 But bonobos show us the other side of the coin. 
 While chimpanzees are dominated by big, scary guys, bonobo society is run by empowered females. 
 These guys have really worked something out, since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet. 
 But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of the great apes. 
 They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it has been very difficult to study them. 
 The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War. 
 Not surprisingly, this destruction also endangers bonobo survival. 
 Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world -- and we're not even sure of that to be honest. 
 Yet, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees. 
 Who are these cousins? 
 We know them as the "make love, not war" apes since they have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues. 
 Now, I'm not saying this is the solution since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra. 
 Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their entire lives. 
 Play is not just child's games. 
 For us and them, play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance. 
 It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game. 
 Play increases creativity and resilience, and it's all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections. 
 And when you watch bonobo play, you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter, dance and ritual. 
 Play is the glue that binds us together. 
 Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild. 
 First, it's a ball game bonobo-style -- and I do not mean football. 
 So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game. 
 Have a look what she's doing. 
 It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "she's got him by the balls." 
 Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right? 
 Yeah. 
 So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans. 
 And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun. 
 But play's a shapeshifter. 
 Play's a shapeshifter, and it can take many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew. 
 And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water. 
 I think, like her, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds. 
 And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, drives us to interact, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity. 
 So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present. 
 But they also hold a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation. 
 The secret is that play is the key to these capacities. 
 In other words, play is our adaptive wildcard. 
 In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play. 
 But will we make the most of our playfulness? 
 Play is not frivolous. 
 Play's essential. 
 For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just red in tooth and claw. 
 In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it is most urgent. 
 And so, my fellow primates, let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together, as we rediscover creativity, fellowship and wonder. 
 Thank you. 
 I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day, at the exact same moment, each conceiving a baby -- okay? 
 So two couples each conceiving one baby. 
 Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception, because if you spend all that time imagining that conception, you're not going to listen to me. 
 So just imagine that for a moment. 
 And in this scenario, I want to imagine that, in one case, the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome, meeting that X chromosome of the egg. 
 And in the other case, the sperm is carrying an X chromosome, meeting the X chromosome of the egg. 
 Both are viable; both take off. 
 We'll come back to these people later. 
 So I wear two hats in most of what I do. 
 As the one hat, I do history of anatomy. 
 I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies, animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies. 
 The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate -- or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors. 
 In that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms. 
 So some of what I've worked on, for example, is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body. 
 Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism -- so people who are much shorter than typical. 
 And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex -- so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types. 
 And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this. 
 Intersex comes in a lot of different forms. 
 I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female. 
 So in one instance, you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis, and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life, to become testes. 
 And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone. 
 But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone, the body doesn't react to the testosterone. 
 And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome. 
 So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it. 
 As a consequence, the body develops more along the female typical path. 
 When the child is born, she looks like a girl. 
 She is a girl. She is raised as a girl. 
 And it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts, but she's not getting her period, that somebody figures out something's up here. 
 And they do some tests and figure out that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus, she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome. 
 Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male, but they're really not. 
 Females, like males, have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands. 
 They're in the back of our body. 
 And the adrenal glands make androgens, which are a masculinizing hormone. 
 Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up but I think I'm probably typical -- most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive. 
 We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens. 
 The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome. 
 So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways, they can be all over the place. 
 Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside. 
 What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 
 He had XX chromosomes, and in the womb, his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment. 
 And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed, his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones. 
 And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything. 
 And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally, that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally. 
 Okay, so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex. 
 Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis, which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it. 
 And we're not exactly sure why that happens. 
 So sex can come in lots of different varieties. 
 The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning, or it's an intersex type -- are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health. 
 In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy. 
 The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories. 
 Or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity. 
 So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity; what it means to be a black person is, allegedly, is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history. 
 And so we have this terribly simplistic idea. 
 And when we're faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different, it startles us in terms of those categorizations. 
 So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism. 
 And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism. 
 Well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body. 
 Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya, had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin. 
 I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me, "Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female?" 
 And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test. 
 In fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female, or between male and intersex and female and intersex; we actually draw that line on nature. 
 So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes, the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought. 
 And it's not just in terms of sex. 
 It's also in terms of race, which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed. 
 As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas. 
 We look, for example, about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees. 
 What are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides? 
 And as we get farther and farther with our science, we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic. 
 So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life. 
 One of the places we're seeing it, for example, in our culture today, in the United States today, is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life. 
 We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human, such that it has a different right than a fetal life. 
 We have very difficult conversations nowadays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody's dead. 
 In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead. 
 At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet. 
 If it stopped twitching, you bury them. 
 But today, we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings. 
 And as a consequence, we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who's dead, and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before. 
 Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories would make somebody like me really happy. 
 I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous. 
 Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense. 
 And it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy. 
 So in order to tell you about that tension, I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers. 
 I know they were racists, I know they were sexist, but they were great. 
 I mean, they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years, and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable. 
 It's because of what happened in 1776 with the Founding Fathers. 
 The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view, the original anatomical activists, and this is why. 
 What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years. 
 So as you all recall, what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy, and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy. 
 The monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA, but they did have a concept of birthright. 
 They had a concept of blue blood. 
 They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth. 
 The Founding Fathers rejected that idea, and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept, and that concept was all men are created equal. 
 They leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy, not the difference in anatomy, and that was a really radical thing to do. 
 Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an Enlightenment system where two things were growing up together. 
 And that was democracy growing up, but it was also science growing up at the same time. 
 And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers, a lot of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world. 
 They were moving away from supernatural explanations, and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power, where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright. 
 They were moving towards a naturalistic concept. 
 And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and nature's God. 
 They don't talk about God and God's nature. 
 They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are. 
 So as part of that, they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality. 
 And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future. 
 They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great. 
 So what happened years afterward? 
 What happened was women, for example, who wanted the right to vote, took the Founding Fathers' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said, "The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote, the right to full citizenship, the right to own property, etc., etc." 
 And women successfully argued that. 
 Next came the successful Civil Rights movement, where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about, "Ain't I a woman?" 
 We find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I am a man." 
 Again, people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy, again, successfully. 
 We see the same thing with the disability rights movement. 
 The problem is, of course, that, as we begin to look at all that commonality, we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions. 
 Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions, anatomically, in our culture. 
 For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human. 
 I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy. 
 I don't want to say five-year-olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry. 
 So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain. 
 But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning. 
 So let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk. 
 We have two beings, both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day. 
 Let's imagine one of them, Mary, is born three months prematurely, so she's born on June 1, 1980. 
 Henry, by contrast, is born at term, so he's born on March 1, 1980. 
 Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months, she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink. 
 Henry has to wait for all of that, not because he's actually any different in age, biologically, except in terms of when he was born. 
 We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are. 
 Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although I haven't told you that he's the XY one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted, which Mary does not need to worry about. 
 Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states, namely, the right to marry. 
 Henry can marry in every state a woman, but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman. 
 So we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable. 
 And the question to me becomes: What do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy, that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart? 
 I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us. 
 So where do we go? 
 It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude: "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line somewhere." 
 But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position. 
 So for example, Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome, and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome. 
 Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes. 
 But this is also very bizarre, because of the story I told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome. 
 If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech. 
 He says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character," moving beyond anatomy. 
 And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea." 
 But in practice, how do you do it? 
 How do you judge people based on the content of character? 
 I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans, because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know. 
 I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know. 
 So how do we operationalize the question of content of character? 
 It turns out to be really difficult. 
 And part of me also wonders, what if content of character turns out to be something that's scannable in the future -- able to be seen with an fMRI? 
 Do we really want to go there? 
 I'm not sure where we go. 
 What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy. 
 We've done a really good job struggling with democracy, and I think we would do a good job in the future. 
 We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example, where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered, unless he's willing to submit to a sex change, in which case he's allowed to live. 
 We don't have that kind of situation. 
 I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself. 
 But when I was on the phone with him, asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-risk surgery -- his answer was that, in this other nation, these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this. 
 My response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery?" 
 The United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are, without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state. 
 So I think we have to be in the lead. 
 Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the fathers. 
 And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like, if we had more involved the mothers. 
 And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups. 
 Now for years, because I've been interested in intersex, I've also been interested in sex difference research. 
 And one of the things that I've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world. 
 And what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females, on average -- not everyone, but on average -- are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group. 
 And so if we think about that, we have an interesting situation on our hands. 
 Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I considered myself a feminist, as I still do -- asked a really strange question. 
 He said, "Tell me what's feminine about feminism." 
 And I thought, "Well that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. 
 Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender, so there's nothing feminine about feminism." 
 But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism. 
 That is to say, there might be something, on average, different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable. 
 So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state, it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept, what we would have is more of a concept of, not just how to protect, but how to care for each other. 
 And maybe that's where we need to go in the future, when we take democracy beyond anatomy, is to think less about the individual body, in terms of the identity, and think more about those relationships. 
 So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union, we're thinking about what we do for each other. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase. 
 But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is, I'm outfit-obsessed. 
 I love finding, wearing, and more recently, photographing and blogging a different, colorful, crazy outfit for every single occasion. 
 But I don't buy anything new. 
 I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores. 
 Aww, thank you. 
 Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet. 
 I get to meet all kinds of great people; my dollars usually go to a good cause; I look pretty unique; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt. 
 I mean, what am I going to find today? 
 Is it going to be my size? 
 Will I like the color? 
 Will it be under $20? 
 If all the answers are yes, I feel as though I've won. 
 I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED. 
 I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her? 
 So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought. 
 I brought seven pairs of underpants and that's it. 
 Exactly one week's worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase. 
 I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs. 
 And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear -- that means I found a few things. 
 And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now. 
 Does that sound good? 
 So as I do this, I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that, believe it or not, I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new. 
 So let's start with Sunday. 
 I call this "Shiny Tiger." 
 You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great. 
 You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50. 
 This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me $55, and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week. 
 Monday: Color is powerful. 
 It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants. 
 If you are happy, you are going to attract other happy people to you. 
 Tuesday: Fitting in is way overrated. 
 I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in. 
 Just be who you are. 
 If you are surrounding yourself with the right people, they will not only get it, they will appreciate it. 
 Wednesday: Embrace your inner child. 
 Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress-up, or that I remind them of their seven-year-old. 
 I like to smile and say, "Thank you." 
 Thursday: Confidence is key. 
 If you think you look good in something, you almost certainly do. 
 And if you don't think you look good in something, you're also probably right. 
 I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out. 
 But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant. 
 And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second. 
 If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out, there is no look that you can't pull off. 
 So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience. 
 We should be able to rock anything we want to rock. 
 Thank you. 
 Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you: Gold sequins go with everything. 
 And finally, Saturday: Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word. 
 It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing, and we've had great conversations. 
 So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase. 
 So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything back. 
 Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go. 
 I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner, there is always going to be another crazy, colorful, shiny outfit just waiting for me, if I put a little love in my heart and look. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Thank you. 
 Good afternoon, everybody. 
 I've got something to show you. 
 Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel. 
 This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design. 
 Let me tell you a bit about it. 
 Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally, and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades. 
 Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race, you take a budget, and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car. 
 And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race. 
 Now today, if you want to win the race, actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time, has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car, transmitting this information into the system, and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected. 
 This is what, in engineering terms, you would call a real time control system. 
 And basically, it's a system made of two components -- a sensing and an actuating component. 
 What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives. 
 Our cities, over the past few years, just have been blanketed with networks, electronics. 
 They're becoming like computers in open air. 
 And, as computers in open air, they're starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated. 
 If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal. 
 Just as an aside, I wanted to mention, cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust, but they are 50 percent of the world's population. 
 They are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions. 
 So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal. 
 Beyond cities, all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects. 
 That's from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing at MoMA later this year, during the summer. 
 It's called "Talk to Me." 
 Well our objects, our environment is starting to talk back to us. 
 In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator. 
 And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there. 
 In a certain sense, it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ... 
 you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses, at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said, shouted, "Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?" 
 Well today, for the first time, our environment is starting to talk back to us. 
 And I'll show just a few examples -- again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it. 
 Let's starting with sensing. 
 Well, the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab. 
 It was four and a half years ago in Italy. 
 And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that's a cellphone network -- and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network, that's collected anyway by the operator, in order to understand how the city works. 
 The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006. 
 It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup. 
 Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing, and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt. 
 And anyway, Italy won at the end. 
 Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network. 
 Here you see the city. 
 You see the Colosseum in the middle, the river Tiber. 
 It's morning, before the match. 
 You see the timeline on the top. 
 Early afternoon, people here and there, making calls and moving. 
 The match begins -- silence. 
 France scores. Italy scores. 
 Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom. 
 Second half. End of normal time. 
 First overtime, second. 
 Zidane, the headbutt in a moment. 
 Italy wins. Yeah. 
 Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center. 
 You saw the big peak. 
 The following day, again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time. 
 And then everybody moved down. 
 You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo, where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate, to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day. 
 Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago. 
 Another quick example about sensing: it's not about people, but about things we use and consume. 
 Well today, we know everything about where our objects come from. 
 This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together. 
 But we know very little about where things go. 
 So in this project, we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system. 
 So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle, just over a year ago, to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things, as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway. 
 Then we put a little chip, little tag, onto the trash and then started following it. 
 Here are the results we just obtained. 
 From Seattle ... 
 after one week. 
 With this information we realized there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system. 
 We can actually do the same thing with much less energy. 
 This data was not available before. 
 But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening. 
 But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear, it's still somewhere on the planet. 
 And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there. 
 And if we show that to people, then we can also promote some behavioral change. 
 So that was the reason for the project. 
 My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman, he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing, but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning, and that's actuating our environment. 
 And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain. 
 It started with a question by the mayor of the city, who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space, in architecture. 
 And the question was: How could technology, new technology, be added to that? 
 And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves, solenoid valves, taps, opening and closing. 
 You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water. 
 If those pixels fall, you can write on it, you can show patterns, images, text. 
 And even you can approach it, and it will open up to let you jump through, as you see in this image. 
 Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch. 
 He liked it very much. 
 And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo. 
 We called it Digital Water Pavilion. 
 The whole building is made of water. 
 There's no doors or windows, but when you approach it, it will open up to let you in. 
 The roof also is covered with water. 
 And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof. 
 Or you could close the building, and the whole architecture will disappear, like in this case. 
 You know, these days, you always get images during the winter, when they take the roof down, of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building." 
 No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down, the architecture almost disappears. 
 Here's the building working. 
 You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside. 
 And here was myself trying not to get wet, testing the sensors that open the water. 
 Well, I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working. 
 But actually that night, it was even more fun. 
 All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building, because the way of engaging with the building became something different. 
 Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in, but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water, and you had to jump without getting wet. 
 And that was, for us, was very interesting, because, as architects, as engineers, as designers, we always think about how people will use the things we design. 
 But then reality's always unpredictable. 
 And that's the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people. 
 Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water, and then projections on them. 
 And this is what led us to think about the following project I'll show you now. 
 That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying. 
 Imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air, and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space. 
 Here is the video. 
 So imagine one helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with others, in synchrony. 
 So you can have this cloud. 
 You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions. 
 Or in regular, but in three dimensions, where the thing that changes is the light, not the pixels' position. 
 You can play with a different type. 
 Imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes, different types of resolution. 
 But then the whole thing can be just a 3D cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many, many directions. 
 Here is the real Flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before. 
 When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before. 
 And imagine each of them then controlled by people. 
 You can have each pixel having an input that comes from people, from people's movement, or so and so. 
 I want to show you something here for the first time. 
 We've been working with Roberto Bolle, one of today's top ballet dancers -- the étoile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire. 
 And here you can see Roberto dancing. 
 You see on the left the pixels, the different resolutions being captured. 
 It's both 3D scanning in real time and motion capture. 
 So you can reconstruct a whole movement. 
 You can go all the way through. 
 But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation. 
 So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for Flyfire. 
 I wanted to show you the last project we are working on. 
 It's something we're working on for the London Olympics. 
 It's called The Cloud. 
 And the idea here is, imagine, again, we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising, but with a cloud. 
 Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel. 
 And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that, over the past couple of decades, we went from the physical world to the digital one. 
 This has been digitizing everything, knowledge, and making that accessible through the Internet. 
 Now today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world, from the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical one. 
 This can be, in our case, we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol. 
 That means something built in a city. 
 But tomorrow it can be, in order to tackle today's pressing challenges -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one. 
 So the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together, collectively. 
 The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels, in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles. 
 And those particles are water, where our cloud is a cloud of pixels. 
 It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels. 
 You can move inside, have different types of experiences. 
 You can actually see from underneath, sharing the main moments for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond, and really using it as a way to connect with the community. 
 So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top [of], like London's new mountaintop. 
 You can enter inside it. 
 And a kind of new digital beacon for the night -- but most importantly, a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top. 
 Thank you. 
 As an artist, connection is very important to me. 
 Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected. 
 I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs. 
 I was in awe. 
 My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me. 
 The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year. 
 Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves. 
 Each iceberg has its own individual personality. 
 They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences. 
 Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion. 
 It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves. 
 But the reality is far from it. 
 As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere. 
 As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life. 
 I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again. 
 It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life. 
 Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old. 
 And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old. 
 The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland. 
 It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling. 
 So here it is. 
 You can see on the left side a small boat. 
 That's about a 15-foot boat. 
 And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline. 
 You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there. 
 This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg. 
 It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters. 
 And this video is real time. 
 And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality. 
 Thank you. 
 I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects. 
 But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy. 
 This guy's name is TEMPT. 
 TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s. 
 And he came up home from a run one day and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling." 
 And that was the onset of ALS. 
 So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed. 
 He only has use of his eyes. 
 I was exposed to him. 
 I have a company that does design and animation, so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world. 
 And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony, TEMPT, and his cause. 
 So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money. 
 What are you going to do with it?" 
 And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again. 
 I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me." 
 And I said, "Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking -- don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices?" 
 And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance, you can't actually do that. 
 These devices aren't accessible to people." 
 And I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?" 
 Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?" 
 That's how they communicate -- so run their finger along. 
 I said, "That's archaic. How can that be?" 
 So I showed up with the desire to just write a check, and instead, I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash. 
 I committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- I'm like, "All right, here's the deal: Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine, and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again. 
 Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it." 
 So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that. 
 I met these guys called GRL, Graffiti Research Lab, and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it, and it just registers the negative space. 
 So they go around and do art installations like this. 
 All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle. 
 First it starts with the sexual organs, then it starts with cuss words, then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art. 
 But there was always a life cycle to their presentations. 
 So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome." 
 So that started the journey. 
 And about two years later, about a year later, after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around, we'd accomplished a couple things. 
 One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies, and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine. 
 Which was awesome. 
 And he's seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda, because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing." 
 The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house. 
 My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage, and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house. 
 A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls. 
 But for over two weeks, we programmed, we went to the Venice boardwalk, my kids got involved, my dog got involved, and we created this. 
 This is called the EyeWriter, and you can see the description. 
 This is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk, some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack. 
 We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open, mounted it to an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- you build this yourself, we publish the code for free, you download the software for free. 
 And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitations. 
 There's no insurance company that can say "No." 
 There's no hospital that can say "No." 
 Anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you guys very much. That was awesome. 
 So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to TEMPT's room. 
 I love this picture, because this is someone else's room and that's his room. 
 So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling. 
 And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, carb-fest and all-night sessions, Tony drew again for the first time in seven years. 
 And this is an amazing picture, because this is his life support system, and he's looking over his life support system. 
 We kicked his bed so that he could see out. 
 And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital. 
 And he drew again for the first time, in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was. 
 The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too, so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too. 
 So at the end of this, he sent us an email, and this is what the email said: "That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years. 
 I feel like I had been held underwater, and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe." 
 Isn't that awesome? 
 So that's kind of our battle cry. 
 That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing. 
 And we've got such a long way to go with this. 
 This is an amazing device, but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch. 
 And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more. 
 So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better, faster, stronger. 
 Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment. 
 We've won a bunch of awards. 
 Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing. 
 It's all coming out of our own pockets. 
 So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic." 
 Armstrong Twittered about us, and then in December, Time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool. 
 The coolest thing about this -- and this is what's completing the whole circle -- is that in April of this year, at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets." 
 And "Art of the Streets" is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene -- Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS -- all of these guys will be there. 
 TEMPT's going to be in the show, which is pretty awesome. 
 So basically this is my point: If you see something that's not possible, make it possible. 
 Everything in this room wasn't possible -- this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter -- wasn't possible at one point. 
 Make it possible, everyone in this room. 
 I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen. 
 And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done: if not now, then when? And if not me, then who? 
 Thank you guys. 
 You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact. 
 And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist. 
 You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer. 
 I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies. 
 And you know, an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace. 
 You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany. 
 That's a painting of a circle. 
 A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke. 
 It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about. 
 My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer. 
 I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room, until one teacher saved my life. 
 She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge. 
 She did it in secret. 
 She did it for three years. 
 And I had to get out of town. 
 I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- met a lover -- and back in the '80s, found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations. 
 About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs. Posten, who said, "I need to see you. 
 I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults. 
 Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now. 
 And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to please be quick about this." 
 Well, the next day we were in Cleveland. 
 We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried, and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice. 
 We found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and watched over her family, because it was necessary. 
 It's something we knew how to do. 
 And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands. 
 And what had happened was the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany I talked about presented itself. 
 The epiphany is that death is a part of life. 
 She saved my life; I and my partner saved hers. 
 And you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does. 
 It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today. 
 It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our job to hand those things out. 
 Thank you. 
 Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft. 
 Imagine a plane full of smoke. 
 Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack. 
 It sounds scary. 
 Well I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in 1D. 
 I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants. 
 So I looked at them right away, and they said, "No problem. We probably hit some birds." 
 The pilot had already turned the plane around, and we weren't that far. 
 You could see Manhattan. 
 Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time. 
 The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River. 
 That's usually not the route. 
 He turns off the engines. 
 Now imagine being in a plane with no sound. 
 And then he says three words -- the most unemotional three words I've ever heard. 
 He says, "Brace for impact." 
 I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore. 
 I could see in her eyes, it was terror. Life was over. 
 Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day. 
 I learned that it all changes in an instant. 
 We have this bucket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't, all the fences I wanted to mend, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did. 
 As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, "I collect bad wines." 
 Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it. 
 I no longer want to postpone anything in life. 
 And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life. 
 The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge, which was by not a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret. 
 I've lived a good life. 
 In my own humanity and mistakes, I've tried to get better at everything I tried. 
 But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in. 
 And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter. 
 And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people. 
 And after, as I reflected on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life. 
 It's not perfect, but it's a lot better. 
 I've not had a fight with my wife in two years. 
 It feels great. 
 I no longer try to be right; I choose to be happy. 
 The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going, "15, 14, 13." 
 You can see the water coming. 
 I'm saying, "Please blow up." 
 I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those documentaries. 
 And as we're coming down, I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary. 
 It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives. 
 But it was very sad. 
 I didn't want to go; I love my life. 
 And that sadness really framed in one thought, which is, I only wish for one thing. 
 I only wish I could see my kids grow up. 
 About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter -- first-grader, not much artistic talent ... 
 ... yet. 
 And I'm bawling, I'm crying, like a little kid. 
 And it made all the sense in the world to me. 
 I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad. 
 Above all, above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad. 
 I was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day. 
 I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently. 
 I challenge you guys that are flying today, imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don't -- but imagine, and how would you change? 
 What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever? 
 How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them? 
 And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can? 
 Thank you. 
 The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple. 
 We don't want Iran to get the bomb. 
 Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. 
 The gray boxes that you see, these are real-time control systems. 
 Now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves, we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge. 
 The gray boxes don't run Windows software; they are a completely different technology. 
 But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box, then we are in business. 
 And this is the plot behind Stuxnet. 
 So we start with a Windows dropper. 
 The payload goes onto the gray box, damages the centrifuge, and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished. 
 That's easy, huh? 
 I want to tell you how we found that out. 
 When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago, it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was. 
 The only thing that was known is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part, used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities. 
 And it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems. 
 So that got our attention, and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out. 
 And then some very funny things happened. 
 Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn't like our cheese -- sniffed, but didn't want to eat. 
 Didn't make sense to me. 
 And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese, I realized, well, this is a directed attack. 
 It's completely directed. 
 The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found, and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect is actually running on that target. 
 And if not, Stuxnet does nothing. 
 So that really got my attention, and we started to work on this nearly around the clock, because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is. 
 It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany. 
 So we better find out what the target is soon." 
 So we extracted and decompiled the attack code, and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one. 
 And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information. 
 They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack. 
 They probably even know the shoe size of the operator. 
 So they know everything. 
 And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you this: the payload is rocket science. 
 It's way above everything that we have ever seen before. 
 Here you see a sample of this actual attack code. 
 We are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code. 
 Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language. 
 And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code. 
 So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls, because we know what they do. 
 And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets. 
 So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove. 
 In order to get target theories, we remember that it's definitely hardcore sabotage, it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in Iran, because that's where most of the infections had been reported. 
 Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area. 
 It basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant. 
 So I told my assistant, "Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base." 
 And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data. 
 And that worked pretty well. 
 So we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control. 
 The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge, that black object that you see. 
 And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor, you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode. 
 What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy, that they would not be able to figure this out quickly. 
 The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures. 
 So for example, the number 164 really stands out in that code; you can't overlook it. 
 I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade, and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges. 
 So that made sense, that was a match. 
 And it even got better. 
 These centrifuges in Iran are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages. 
 And guess what we found in the attack code? 
 An almost identical structure. 
 So again, that was a real good match. 
 And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at. 
 Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this. 
 These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor. 
 And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover. 
 Anyway, so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target, but from different angles. 
 The small warhead is taking one cascade, and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down, and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves. 
 So in all, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is. 
 It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz. 
 So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet. 
 Here's some very cool stuff that we saw -- really knocked my socks off. 
 Down there is the gray box, and on the top you see the centrifuges. 
 Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code, which is still running during the attack, with fake input data. 
 And as a matter of fact, this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet. 
 So it's just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist, the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video. 
 That's cool, huh? 
 The idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room. 
 It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive. 
 The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system. 
 We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough. 
 So for example, in a power plant, when your big steam turbine gets too over speed, you must open relief valves within a millisecond. 
 Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator. 
 So this is where we need digital safety systems. 
 And when they are compromised, then real bad things can happen. 
 Your plant can blow up. 
 And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it. 
 That's scary. 
 But it gets worse. 
 And this is very important, what I'm going to say. 
 Think about this: this attack is generic. 
 It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics, with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment. 
 So it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an automobile factory. 
 It is generic. 
 And you don't have -- as an attacker -- you don't have to deliver this payload by a USB stick, as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet. 
 You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading. 
 Just spread it as wide as possible. 
 And if you do that, what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction. 
 That's the consequence that we have to face. 
 So unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East. 
 They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan. 
 So all of the green areas, these are your target-rich environments. 
 We have to face the consequences, and we better start to prepare right now. 
 Thanks. 
 I've got a question. 
 Ralph, it's been quite widely reported that people assume that Mossad is the main entity behind this. 
 Is that your opinion? 
 Okay, you really want to hear that? 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 My opinion is that the Mossad is involved, but that the leading force is not Israel. 
 So the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower. 
 There is only one, and that's the United States -- fortunately, fortunately. 
 Because otherwise, our problems would even be bigger. 
 Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph. 
 My name is Amit. 
 And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google, and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here, and she allowed me to do it. 
 And it took 18 months. 
 A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries. 
 But I'm going to focus on the demo. 
 There are a lot of stories about why we did this. 
 I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide, and it's access. 
 And I grew up in India. 
 I had a great education -- I'm not complaining -- but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks. 
 And so when I started traveling and going to these museums, I started learning a lot. 
 And while working at Google, I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together. 
 So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing this. 
 I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch. 
 So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com. 
 You look around at all these museums here. 
 You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA, the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh. 
 I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
 Two ways of going in -- very simple. 
 Click and, bang, you're in this museum. 
 It doesn't matter where you are -- Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter. 
 You move around, you have fun. 
 You want to navigate around the museum? 
 Open the plan up, and, in one click, jump. 
 You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor. 
 Keep going. Have fun. 
 Explore. 
 Thanks. I haven't come to the best part. 
 So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met. 
 I see this plus sign. 
 If the museum has given us the image, you click on it. 
 Now this is one of the images. 
 So this is all of the meta-data information. 
 For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now. 
 And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology. 
 So this image, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels. 
 And I get a lot of people asking me: "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?" 
 So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels. 
 You can zoom around very simply. 
 You see some fun stuff happening here. 
 I love this guy; his expression is priceless. 
 But then you really want to go deep. 
 And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here. 
 And I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting." 
 Went in, and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something. 
 I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met, and actually found out that this is a game called squall, which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday. 
 And apparently it was quite popular. 
 I don't know why they did it, but I learned something about it. 
 Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks. 
 Now just to give you some perspective, I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get. 
 Here is where we were, and this is the painting. 
 The best is yet to come -- so in a second. 
 So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, again in New York. 
 So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night." 
 Now the example I showed you was all about finding details. 
 But what if you want to see brush strokes? 
 And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece? 
 You zoom in. You really go in. 
 I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks. 
 This is "The Starry Night," I think, never seen like this before. 
 I'm going to show you my other favorite feature. 
 There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time. 
 This is the real cool part. It's called Collections. 
 Any one of you, anybody -- doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor, if you have a fancy house -- doesn't matter. 
 You can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images. 
 Very simply, you go in -- and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom -- you can just zoom around. 
 This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery. 
 You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces. 
 So I think, in conclusion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google. 
 It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums. 
 I probably shouldn't say that. 
 It really comes from these artists. 
 And that's been my humbling experience in this. 
 I mean, I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online. 
 And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is, "Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum?" 
 And the answer is no. 
 It's to supplement the experience. 
 And that's it. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 This is a representation of your brain, and your brain can be broken into two parts. 
 There's the left half, which is the logical side, and then the right half, which is the intuitive. 
 And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere, then we can plot our brain. 
 And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical. 
 This would be someone who's entirely intuitive. 
 So where would you put your brain on this scale? 
 Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes, but I think for most people in the audience, your brain is something like this -- with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time. 
 It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything. 
 You can be logical and intuitive. 
 And so I consider myself one of these people, along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists, who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas. 
 But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work. 
 How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff. 
 So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts, and then we develop our intuition from there. 
 And really you do the same thing. 
 So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time. 
 I mean, it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it. 
 And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop. 
 He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over. 
 But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson, and that's that large things don't let you get right past them, and that they stay in one place. 
 And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world, unless you're a particle physicist. 
 It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with car stops, they play with these little weird particles. 
 And when they play with their particles, they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time. 
 And so they wrote down all these observations, and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics. 
 And so that's where physics was at a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little, tiny particles. 
 But you didn't need it to describe the large, everyday objects around us. 
 This didn't really sit well with my intuition, and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often. 
 Well, I play with them sometimes, but not very often. 
 And I've never seen them. 
 I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle. 
 But it didn't sit well with my logical side either. 
 Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics, then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics? 
 I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. 
 And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics. 
 So a few years ago, I set off to do just that. 
 So I made one. 
 This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition. 
 So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip. 
 And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle. 
 And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute. 
 This is a photograph of the object. 
 And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center. 
 And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal. 
 So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal, and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge. 
 And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip. 
 I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer, and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours. 
 For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device. 
 This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition, but it needs a little help to do it. 
 Here, let me give you an analogy. 
 You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator? 
 I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them, or, frankly, scare them. 
 So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way. 
 The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people, and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room. 
 And so we knew, if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically, we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers. 
 And so that's what we did. 
 We turned off the lights, and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. 
 Now, all alone in the elevator, the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted. 
 And so we measured its motion. 
 We found it was moving in really weird ways. 
 Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating, and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows. 
 And by giving it a gentle nudge, we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics. 
 So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic. 
 What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time? 
 So let's think about the atoms. 
 So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down. 
 Now it's only at precise times when they align. 
 The rest of the time they're delocalized. 
 That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places. 
 I think this is really cool. 
 Really. 
 It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because, check this out, the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you. 
 So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, that chunk of metal can be in two different places, then why not you? 
 I mean, this is just my logical side talking. 
 So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time, what would that be like? 
 How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space? 
 There's one more part to the story. 
 It's when we warmed it up, and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece. 
 And so I had to develop this new intuition, that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. 
 You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected. 
 Well, that's not quite right. 
 It's more than that; it's deeper. 
 It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics. 
 Thank you. 
 In 2007, I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development. 
 Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work, they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents. 
 Now we're a long way away from that goal right now. 
 There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them. 
 But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them. 
 So we could easily supply the world with dozens, maybe hundreds, of new cities. 
 Now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities. 
 But just substitute apartment building for cities. 
 Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them; the other half aren't there yet. 
 You could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments. 
 But you know what you'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction. 
 So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions. 
 But you could go out someplace brand new, build a brand new apartment building, as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way. 
 So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name: charter cities. 
 Later I learned that at about this same time, Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras. 
 They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year would leave to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Honduras. 
 At one point, Javier said to Octavio, "What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States, they can go get jobs, do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?" 
 In the summer of 2009, Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis. 
 At the next regularly scheduled election, Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform, but reconciliation as well. 
 He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff. 
 Meanwhile, I was getting ready to give a talk at TEDGlobal. 
 Through a process of refinement, trial and error, a lot of user testing, I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials. 
 The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders. 
 We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes technologies and rules to get progress, and it's usually the rules that hold us back. 
 In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk. 
 He showed it to Javier. 
 They called me. 
 They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country." 
 So in December we met in Miami, in a hotel conference room. 
 I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, how much more valuable they are than they cost. 
 And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City: notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases, per square meter. 
 But it was a fairly abstract discussion, and at some point when there was a pause, Octavio said, "Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk." 
 So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms, a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land, a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in, to go live under those rules or not. 
 So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project, this is important, this could be the way forward for our country. 
 I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and talk again on January fourth and fifth. 
 So I presented another fact-filled lecture that included a slide like this, which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city, it has to be very big. 
 This is a picture of Denver, and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver. 
 This airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers. 
 So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans, if you build a new city, you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers. 
 That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres. 
 Everybody applauded politely. 
 The faces in the audience were very serious and attentive. 
 The leader of the congress came up on stage and said, "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture, but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk. 
 I've got it here on my laptop." 
 So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk. 
 And it got to the essence, which is that a new city could offer new choices for people. 
 There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Honduras, instead of hundreds of miles away in the North. 
 And it also involved new choices for leaders. 
 Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras would need help from partner countries, who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement, so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced. 
 And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust. 
 We went and looked at a site. 
 This picture's from there. 
 It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers. 
 And shortly thereafter, on January 19th, they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions. 
 In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis, the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one. 
 All parties, all factions in society, backed this. 
 To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress. 
 On February 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one. 
 Immediately after that vote, on February 21st to the 24th, a delegation of about 30 Hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business. 
 One is South Korea. 
 This is a picture of a big, new city center that's being built in South Korea -- bigger than downtown Boston. 
 Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the permits. 
 The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore. 
 They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third. 
 So if you think about this practically, here's where we are. 
 They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city. 
 They're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in, and also an external legal system. 
 One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there. 
 There's designers and builders of cities who are very interested. 
 They even can bring with them some financing. 
 But the one thing you know they've already solved is that there's lots of tenants. 
 There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's lots of people who'd like to go there. 
 Around the world, there's 700 million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now. 
 There's a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States. 
 Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing. 
 Sadly, sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade. 
 So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Honduras? 
 Or to build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these, around the world? 
 What kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents? 
 This is an idea worth spreading. 
 And my friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you, TED. 
 Everything I do, and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa. 
 From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not — -- I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. 
 I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project that we set up in Africa failed. 
 And I was distraught. 
 I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa. 
 Instead, everything we touched we killed. 
 Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book, "Ripples from the Zambezi," was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food. 
 So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River, and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ... 
 And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that, so we paid them to come and work, and sometimes they would show up. 
 And we were amazed that the local people, in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture. 
 But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." 
 "Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation." 
 And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully. 
 We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size. 
 And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians, "Look how easy agriculture is." 
 When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red, overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything. 
 And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!" 
 And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." 
 "Why didn't you tell us?" "You never asked." 
 I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the English were doing, what the French were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I became quite proud of our project in Zambia. 
 Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos. 
 You should see the rubbish — -- You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people. 
 You want to read the book, read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo, Zambian woman economist. 
 The book was published in 2009. 
 We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years. 
 I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done. 
 Just go and read her book. 
 Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done. 
 We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people: We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic. 
 The two words come from the Latin root "pater," which means "father." 
 But they mean two different things. 
 Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much." 
 Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants. 
 That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss. 
 I was given a slap in the face reading a book, "Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said, above all in economic development, if people do not wish to be helped, leave them alone. 
 This should be the first principle of aid. 
 The first principle of aid is respect. 
 This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor, and said, "Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial?" 
 I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people, and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation, where you never initiate anything, you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant of the local passion, the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person. 
 So what you do -- you shut up. 
 You never arrive in a community with any ideas, and you sit with the local people. 
 We don't work from offices. 
 We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub. 
 We have zero infrastructure. 
 And what we do, we become friends, and we find out what that person wants to do. 
 The most important thing is passion. 
 You can give somebody an idea. 
 If that person doesn't want to do it, what are you going to do? 
 The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing. 
 The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing. 
 And then we help them to go and find the knowledge, because nobody in the world can succeed alone. 
 The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available. 
 So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do, why don't, for once, listen to them? But not in community meetings. 
 Let me tell you a secret. 
 There is a problem with community meetings. 
 Entrepreneurs never come, and they never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have identified. 
 So planning has this blind spot. 
 The smartest people in your community you don't even know, because they don't come to your public meetings. 
 What we do, we work one-on-one, and to work one-on-one, you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist. 
 You have to create a new profession. 
 The profession is the family doctor of enterprise, the family doctor of business, who sits with you in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe, and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living. 
 I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia. 
 I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do. 
 And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets, and in three days I had my first client, and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy, and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth, to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say, "You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?" 
 And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo, and the farmers came to talk to me, said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?" 
 In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to see me to say, "How can you do that? 
 How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult. 
 I shut up, and listen to them." 
 So — — So the government says, "Do it again." 
 We've done it in 300 communities around the world. 
 We have helped to start 40,000 businesses. 
 There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude. 
 Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history, died age 96, a few years ago. 
 Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business, and this is what Peter Drucker says: "Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy." 
 Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship. 
 So now you're rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy. 
 You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you. 
 You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy, you have to be fantastic at helping them, and then they will come, and they will come in droves. 
 In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients. 
 Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion? 
 Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning? 
 Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded. 
 So what I'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it's at. 
 We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable. 
 The internal combustion engine is not sustainable. 
 Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable. 
 What we have to look at is at how we feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way. 
 The technologies do not exist to do that. 
 Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it! 
 Government? Forget about it! 
 It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now. 
 There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many, many years ago. 
 There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860. 
 And in 1860, this group of people came together, and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was unanimous: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years. 
 Why? Because they looked at the curve and said, if the population keeps growing at this rate, to move the population of New York around, they would have needed six million horses, and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with. 
 They were already drowning in manure. 
 So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York. 
 So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900, in the United States of America, there were 1,001 car manufacturing companies -- 1,001. 
 The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over, and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters. 
 Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford. 
 However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs. 
 First, you have to offer them confidentiality. 
 Otherwise they don't come and talk to you. 
 Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated, passionate service to them. 
 And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship. 
 The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be capable of doing three things beautifully: The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have fantastic marketing, and you have to have tremendous financial management. 
 Guess what? 
 We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money. 
 It doesn't exist. 
 This person has never been born. 
 We've done the research, and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, all the new companies, Google, Yahoo. 
 There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None were started by one person. 
 Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland, and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography, and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline, in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography how many times Richard uses the word "I" and how many times he uses the word "we." 
 Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times. 
 He wasn't alone when he started. 
 Nobody started a company alone. No one. 
 So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic, somebody who will say to you, "What do you need? 
 What can you do? Can you make it? 
 Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?" 
 "Oh, no, I cannot do this." "Would you like me to find you somebody?" 
 We activate communities. 
 We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion, the energy and imagination of your own people. 
 Thank you. 
 Five years ago, I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland. 
 Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, to teach a communications class for engineering students. 
 And I was scared. 
 Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words. 
 But as these conversations unfolded, I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world. 
 That's just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students. I was amazed at the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well. 
 And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication. 
 We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world. 
 Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy to environment to health care, among others, and if we don't know about it and understand it, then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility as non-scientists to have these interactions. 
 But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland. 
 So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us. 
 I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging. 
 First question to answer for us: so what? 
 Tell us why your science is relevant to us. 
 Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae, but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis. 
 And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon. 
 Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas. 
 Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say "space and time," which is so much more accessible to us? 
 And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down. 
 Instead, as Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler. 
 You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas. 
 A few things to consider are having examples, stories and analogies. Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content. 
 And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points. 
 Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points? 
 What do bullets do? Bullets kill, and they will kill your presentation. 
 A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed. 
 Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective. It's showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower. 
 And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost, and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's being described. 
 So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering. 
 And because the engineers that I've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd, I want to summarize with an equation. 
 Take your science, subtract your bullet points and your jargon, divide by relevance, meaning share what's relevant to the audience, and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you're doing, and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding. 
 And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me. 
 Thank you. 
 One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is "snollygoster." 
 Just because it sounds so good. 
 And what snollygoster means is "a dishonest politician." 
 Although there was a 19th-century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said, "A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party, platform or principle, and who, when he wins, gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy." 
 Now I have no idea what "talknophical" is. 
 Something to do with words, I assume. 
 But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know they have to try and control language. 
 It wasn't until, for example, 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber. 
 And this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who took on Parliament. 
 And he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to take them on, and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won. 
 And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase "as bold as brass." 
 Most people think that's down to the metal. 
 It's not. It's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press. 
 But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want to take you back to the United States of America, just after they'd achieved independence. 
 And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington, their leader. 
 They didn't know. 
 What do you call the leader of a republican country? 
 And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages. 
 And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table, which might have made it. 
 I mean, some people wanted him to be called Chief Magistrate Washington, and other people, His Highness George Washington, and other people, Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington. 
 Not that catchy. 
 Some people just wanted to call him King. 
 They thought it was tried and tested. 
 And they weren't even being monarchical there, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term. 
 And, you know, it could have worked. 
 And everybody got insanely bored, actually, because this debate went on for three weeks. 
 I read a diary of this poor senator, who just keeps coming back, "Still on this subject." 
 And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate. 
 The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power. 
 They didn't want to call him King in case that gave him ideas, or his successor ideas. 
 So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest, most pathetic title that they could think of. 
 And that title was "President." 
 President. They didn't invent the title. I mean, it existed before, but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting. 
 It was like the foreman of the jury. 
 And it didn't have much more grandeur than the term "foreman" or "overseer." 
 There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government, but it was really a nothing title. 
 And that's why the Senate objected to it. 
 They said, that's ridiculous, you can't call him President. 
 This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries. 
 And who's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of the United States of America? 
 And after three weeks of debate, in the end the Senate did not cave in. 
 Instead, they agreed to use the title "President" for now, but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn't agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations, whether under republican or monarchical forms of government, whose custom it is to annex, through the office of the Chief Magistrate, titles of respectability -- not bloody President -- and that in the intercourse with foreign nations, the majesty of the people of the United States may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity, i.e., we don't want to look like bloody weirdos. 
 Now you can learn three interesting things from this. 
 First of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I've ever been able to find out, the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President. 
 Barack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time, just waiting for the Senate to spring into action. 
 Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 223 years later. 
 But the third thing you can learn, and this is the really important one, this is the point I want to leave you on, is that the title, President of the United States of America, doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it? 
 Something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff. 
 Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur. 
 And so the Senate won in the end. 
 They got their title of respectability. 
 And also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity -- well, it was a singularity back then. 
 But now, do you know how many nations have a president? 
 A hundred and forty-seven. 
 All because they want to sound like the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc. 
 And so, in the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost, because nobody's going to feel that humble when they're told that they are now the President of the United States of America. 
 And that's the important lesson I think you can take away, and the one I want to leave you with. 
 Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality. 
 Thank you very much. 
 So I arrived by truck with about 50 rebels to the battle for Jalalabad as a 19-year-old vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida. 
 I traded my Converse black low-tops for a pair of brown leather sandals and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn't even see. 
 And this was my first time in Afghanistan. 
 Long before that I had grown up with the war, but alongside weekend sleepovers and Saturday soccer games and fistfights with racist children of the Confederacy and religio-nationalist demonstrations chanting, "Down with communism and long live Afghanistan," and burning effigies of Brezhnev before I even knew what it meant. 
 But this is the geography of self. 
 And so I stand here today, Afghan by blood, redneck by the grace of God, an atheist and a radically politicized artist who's been living, working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years. 
 Now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan, but personally I don't want to paint rainbows; I want to make art that disturbs identity and challenges authority and exposes hypocrisy and reinterprets reality and even uses kind of an imaginative ethnography to try and understand the world that we live in. 
 I want to spend a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like popstar bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich. 
 And where else can the jihadi gangster go, but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan: "Vote for me! I've done jihad, and I'm rich." 
 And try and use this campaign to expose these mafiosos who are masquerading as national heroes. 
 I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called "Payback" and impersonate a police officer, set up a fake checkpoint on the street of Kabul and stop cars, but instead of asking them for a bribe, offering them money and apologizing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they'll accept this 100 Afghanis on our behalf. 
 I want to look at how, in my opinion, the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict chic. 
 The war and the expatriate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fox fur and add it to a flack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashionable neo-traditional vests. 
 And I'd like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheelbarrow and putting it on the wall amidst Kipling's call of 1899 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday's colonial rhetoric about a "white man's burden" to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civilize him a bit. 
 But doing these things, they can get you in jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted. 
 But I do them because I have to, because the geography of self mandates it. 
 That is my burden. What's yours? 
 Thank you. 
 I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile: "Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him. 
 But don't you ever turn into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary." 
 Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out, inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions. 
 I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi. 
 And there it was, a great revolution. 
 Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime, raising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice. 
 They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi. 
 They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south. 
 Eventually, after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant. 
 However, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions. 
 For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society. 
 Aware of the devastation and the challenges, I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society, calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation. 
 Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi -- almost 300 in Tripoli. 
 After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya, and with unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills. 
 With an amazing group of women, I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace, a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life, to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace. 
 I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections, an environment which was increasingly polarized, an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion. 
 I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law, a law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background, the right to vote and run, and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists, creating the zipper list. 
 Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful. 
 Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 52 years. 
 However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections, and of the revolution as a whole, was fading out -- for every day we were waking up to the news of violence. 
 One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs. 
 On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate. 
 On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers. 
 And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law. 
 Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset, became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles -- freedom, dignity, social justice -- that we first held. 
 Intolerance, exclusion and revenge became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution. 
 I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections. 
 I'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision. 
 We did not prioritize right. 
 For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya. 
 Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation? 
 No, it didn't. 
 What is it, then? 
 Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women? 
 Maybe what was missing was not the women only, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion. 
 Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections, which only reinforced polarization and division. 
 Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine. 
 We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage. 
 We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy. 
 We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion. 
 These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace. 
 For peace has an alchemy, and this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives. 
 That's the real zipper. 
 And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically. 
 According to a Quranic verse "Salam" -- peace -- "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem." 
 In turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions, has the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" -- womb -- symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female, from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from. 
 And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it, the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence. 
 Thus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things." 
 Thus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger." 
 May we all be granted a grace of mercy. 
 Thank you. 
 Today I have just one request. 
 Please don't tell me I'm normal. 
 Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers. 
 Remi is 22, tall and very handsome. 
 He's speechless, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot. 
 Remi knows what love is. 
 He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless. 
 He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color. 
 He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this: He has never told a lie. 
 When he sings songs from our childhood, attempting words that not even I could remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful the unknown must be. 
 Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome. 
 He has the most impeccable memory. 
 He has a selective one, though. 
 He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar, but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod, conversations we had when he was four, weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies, and Lady Gaga's birthday. 
 Don't they sound incredible? 
 But most people don't agree. 
 And in fact, because their minds don't fit into society's version of normal, they're often bypassed and misunderstood. 
 But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case, although they were not seen as ordinary, this could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary. 
 Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills. 
 It manifests in each individual differently, hence why Remi is so different from Sam. 
 And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world, there is no known cause or cure. 
 And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism, but I cannot recall a day without it. 
 I was just three years old when my brother came along, and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life. 
 And after a few months went by, I realized that he was different. 
 He screamed a lot. 
 He didn't want to play like the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me whatsoever. 
 Remi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between. 
 And as he grew older, he grew more different, and the differences became more obvious. 
 Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never-ending hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never lied. 
 Extraordinary. 
 Now, I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family, moments where I've wished that they were just like me. 
 But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me about individuality and communication and love, and I realize that these are things that I wouldn't want to change with normality. 
 Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong. 
 It just means that there's a different kind of right. 
 And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal. 
 You can be extraordinary. 
 Because autistic or not, the differences that we have -- We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential. 
 The chance for greatness, for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else. 
 Please -- don't tell me I'm normal. 
 Thank you. 
 Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple, and exposure just a millionth of a second. 
 But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million, or a billion, but one trillion frames per second. 
 I present you a new type of photography, femto-photography, a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion. 
 And with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners, beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X-ray, and really challenge what we mean by a camera. 
 Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second -- which is several femtoseconds -- I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide, and that packet of photons, that bullet, will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet. 
 Now, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle, how will those photons shatter into this bottle? 
 How does light look in slow motion? 
 Now, the whole event 
 Now, remember, the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond — that's how much time it takes for light to travel — but I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion. 
 But, Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research. 
 Now, there's a lot going on in this movie, so let me break this down and show you what's going on. 
 So, the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet, with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside. 
 Some of the light leaks, goes on the table, and you start seeing these ripples of waves. 
 Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions. 
 As you can see, there's a bubble of air, and it's bouncing around inside. 
 Meanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table, and because of the reflections at the top, you see at the back of the bottle, after several frames, the reflections are focused. 
 Now, if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion, do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie? 
 A day, a week? Actually, a whole year. 
 It'll be a very boring movie — — of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion. 
 And what about some still-life photography? 
 You can watch the ripples again washing over the table, the tomato and the wall in the back. 
 It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water. 
 I thought, this is how nature paints a photo, one femto frame at a time, but of course our eye sees an integral composite. 
 But if you look at this tomato one more time, you will notice, as the light washes over the tomato, it continues to glow. It doesn't become dark. 
 Why is that? Because the tomato is actually ripe, and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato, and it comes out after several trillionths of a second. 
 So, in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone, you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it. 
 So how did my team at MIT create this camera? 
 Now, as photographers, you know, if you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light, but we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure, so you're going to get hardly any light. 
 So, what we do is we send that bullet, those packet of photons, millions of times, and record again and again with very clever synchronization, and from the gigabytes of data, we computationally weave together to create those femto-videos I showed you. 
 And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways. 
 So, Superman can fly. 
 Some other heroes can become invisible, but what about a new power for a future superhero: to see around corners? 
 The idea is that we could shine some light on the door. 
 It's going to bounce, go inside the room, some of that is going to reflect back on the door, and then back to the camera, and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light. 
 And it's not science fiction. We have actually built it. 
 On the left, you see our femto-camera. 
 There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall, and we're going to bounce light off the door. 
 So after our paper was published in Nature Communications, it was highlighted by Nature.com, and they created this animation. 
 We're going to fire those bullets of light, and they're going to hit this wall, and because the packet of the photons, they will scatter in all the directions, and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin, which in turn will again scatter that light, and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light, and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera, but most interestingly, they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot. 
 And because we have a camera that can run so fast, our femto-camera, it has some unique abilities. 
 It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light. 
 And this way, we know the distances, of course to the door, but also to the hidden objects, but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance. 
 By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo, which, you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense, but then we will take a lot of such pictures, dozens of such pictures, put them together, and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light, and from that, can we see the hidden object? 
 Can we see it in full 3D? 
 So this is our reconstruction. 
 Now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the bend, or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows, or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders, and also for cardioscopes. 
 But of course, because of tissue and blood, this is quite challenging, so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto-photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems. 
 Now, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself, science became art, an art of ultra-fast photography, and I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging, but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time-lapse and color-coding, and we look at those ripples. Remember, the time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second. 
 But there's also something funny going on here. 
 When you look at the ripples under the cap, the ripples are moving away from us. 
 The ripples should be moving towards us. 
 What's going on here? 
 It turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this picture. 
 The order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes reversed order, so by applying the corresponding space and time warp, we can correct for this distortion. 
 So whether it's for photography around corners, or creating the next generation of health imaging, or creating new visualizations, since our invention, we have open-sourced all the data and details on our website, and our hope is that the DIY, the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras — — and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging. 
 It's about time. Thank you. 
 This is where I live. I live in Kenya, at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park. 
 Those are my dad's cows at the back, and behind the cows, that's the Nairobi National Park. 
 Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely, which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely. 
 So predators like lions follow them, and this is what they do. 
 They kill our livestock. 
 This is one of the cows which was killed at night, and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead, and I felt so bad, because it was the only bull we had. 
 My community, the Maasai, we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them, and that's why we value them so much. 
 So I grew up hating lions so much. 
 The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock, and they're also upset about this problem. 
 So they kill the lions. 
 It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi. 
 And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few. 
 So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community is responsible for his dad's cows, and that's the same thing which happened to me. 
 So I had to find a way of solving this problem. 
 And the first idea I got was to use fire, because I thought lions were scared of fire. 
 But I came to realize that that didn't really help, because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed. 
 So I didn't give up. I continued. 
 And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow. 
 I was trying to trick the lions [into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed. 
 But lions are very clever. 
 They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back, but the second day, they'll come and they say, this thing is not moving here, it's always here. 
 So he jumps in and kills the animals. 
 So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch, and that day, the lions didn't come. 
 And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light. 
 So I had an idea. 
 Since I was a small boy, I used to work in my room for the whole day, and I even took apart my mom's new radio, and that day she almost killed me, but I learned a lot about electronics. 
 So I got an old car battery, an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle, and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks. 
 And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off. 
 And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. 
 So I set up everything. 
 As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery, and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer. 
 And the indicator box makes the lights flash. 
 As you can see, the bulbs face outside, because that's where the lions come from. 
 And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night. 
 The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed, but I was sleeping in my bed. 
 Thanks. 
 So I set it up in my home two years ago, and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions. 
 And my neighboring homes heard about this idea. 
 One of them was this grandmother. 
 She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions, and she asked me if I could put the lights for her. 
 And I said, "Yes." 
 So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights. 
 Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community, and they're really working. 
 And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards, and it's also being used to scare elephants away from people's farms. 
 Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited about this. 
 My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness. 
 I even took my friends back to my community, and we're installing the lights to the homes which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them. 
 So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father's cows, and I used to see planes flying over, and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside. 
 And here I am today. 
 I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED. 
 So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up. 
 I used to hate lions, but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions, we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict. 
 Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much. 
 You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours. 
 So you got this scholarship. Yep. 
 You're working on other electrical inventions. 
 What's the next one on your list? 
 My next invention is, I want to make an electric fence. Electric fence? 
 But I know electric fences are already invented, but I want to make mine. 
 You already tried it once, right, and you -- I tried it before, but I stopped because it gave me a shock. 
 In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else. 
 We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend. 
 Thank you so much. Thank you. 
 I live in South Central. 
 This is South Central: liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. 
 So the city planners, they get together and they figure they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else, so they change it to South Los Angeles, like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city. 
 This is South Los Angeles. 
 Liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. 
 Just like 26.5 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, South Central Los Angeles, home of the drive-thru and the drive-by. 
 Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys. 
 People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles. 
 For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills, which is probably eight, 10 miles away. 
 I got tired of seeing this happening. 
 And I was wondering, how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food, if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood? 
 I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars. 
 I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks. 
 And I figured, this has to stop. 
 So I figured that the problem is the solution. 
 Food is the problem and food is the solution. 
 Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides. 
 So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house. 
 It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway. 
 It's 150 feet by 10 feet. 
 Thing is, it's owned by the city. 
 But you have to maintain it. 
 So I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want, since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it." 
 And this is how I decided to maintain it. 
 So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees, you know, the whole nine, vegetables. 
 What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group, where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life, from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer, and everything we do is free. 
 And the garden, it was beautiful. 
 And then somebody complained. 
 The city came down on me, and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden, which this citation was turning into a warrant. 
 And I'm like, "Come on, really? 
 A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about?" 
 And I was like, "Cool. Bring it." 
 Because this time it wasn't coming up. 
 So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman, and one of the Green Grounds members, they put up a petition on Change.org, and with 900 signatures, we were a success. 
 We had a victory on our hands. 
 My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we're doing. 
 I mean, come on, why wouldn't they? 
 L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns. 
 They own 26 square miles of vacant lots. 
 That's 20 Central Parks. 
 That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants. 
 Why in the hell would they not okay this? 
 Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds. 
 When one dollar's worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce. 
 It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food. 
 Growing your own food is like printing your own money. 
 See, I have a legacy in South Central. 
 I grew up there. I raised my sons there. 
 And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people, and I'm manufacturing my own reality. 
 See, I'm an artist. 
 Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art. 
 Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls, me, I beautiful lawns, parkways. 
 I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees, that's my embellishment for that cloth. 
 You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas. 
 You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people. 
 So what happened? 
 I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education, a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood. 
 To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil. 
 We are the soil. 
 You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this. 
 Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do, especially in the inner city. 
 Plus you get strawberries. 
 I remember this time, there was this mother and a daughter came, it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard, and I came out and they looked so ashamed. 
 So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there, and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this. 
 This is on the street for a reason. 
 It made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry, and this only reinforced why I do this, and people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid people are going to steal your food?" 
 And I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it. 
 That's why it's on the street. 
 That's the whole idea. 
 I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back their health." 
 There's another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles. 
 These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck. 
 It was cool, and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother, and it was just cool to see how this changed them, if it was only for that one moment. 
 So Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens. 
 We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins and participate, and it's all volunteers. 
 If kids grow kale, kids eat kale. 
 If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. 
 But when none of this is presented to them, if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body, they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them. 
 I see young people and they want to work, but they're in this thing where they're caught up -- I see kids of color and they're just on this track that's designed for them, that leads them to nowhere. 
 So with gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities, to have a sustainable life. 
 And when we do this, who knows? 
 We might produce the next George Washington Carver. 
 but if we don't change the composition of the soil, we will never do this. 
 Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do. 
 I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block. 
 I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes. 
 Now don't get me wrong. 
 I'm not talking about no free shit, because free is not sustainable. 
 The funny thing about sustainability, you have to sustain it. 
 What I'm talking about is putting people to work, and getting kids off the street, and letting them know the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food, opening farmer's markets. 
 So what I want to do here, we gotta make this sexy. 
 So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades, gangstas, gangsta gardeners. 
 We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is. 
 If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta. 
 Get gangsta with your shovel, okay? 
 And let that be your weapon of choice. 
 So basically, if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to meet, don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit. 
 If you want to meet with me, come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit. 
 Peace. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Before March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher based in New York City. 
 We're pale, gray creatures. 
 We hide in dark, windowless rooms, and generally avoid sunlight. 
 We make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect, and the impossible possible, and we get criticized in the press all the time, but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography. 
 On March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest of the world did, as the tragic events unfolded in Japan. 
 Soon after, an organization I volunteer with, All Hands Volunteers, were on the ground, within days, working as part of the response efforts. 
 I, along with hundreds of other volunteers, knew we couldn't just sit at home, so I decided to join them for three weeks. 
 On May the 13th, I made my way to the town of Ōfunato. 
 It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture, about 50,000 people, one of the first that was hit by the wave. 
 The waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height, and traveled over two miles inland. 
 As you can imagine, the town had been devastated. 
 We pulled debris from canals and ditches. 
 We cleaned schools. We de-mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation. 
 We cleared tons and tons of stinking, rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant. 
 We got dirty, and we loved it. 
 For weeks, all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things. 
 They'd been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and SD cards. 
 And everyone was doing the same. 
 They were collecting them up, and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping. 
 Now, it wasn't until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt. 
 As they had run from the wave, and for their lives, absolutely everything they had, everything had to be left behind. 
 At the end of my first week there, I found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town. 
 I was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen, the huge giant bathtubs. 
 This happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos. 
 This is where people were handing them in, and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand-cleaning them. 
 Now, it was emotional and it was inspiring, and I've always heard about thinking outside the box, but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened. 
 As I looked through the photos, there were some were over a hundred years old, some still in the envelope from the processing lab, I couldn't help but think as a retoucher that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch, and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same. 
 So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them, and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive, I knew we had to give it a go. 
 So we started retouching photos. 
 This was the very first. 
 Not terribly damaged, but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy. 
 Otherwise, that little girl isn't going to look like that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic as having the photo damaged. 
 Over time, more photos came in, thankfully, and more retouchers were needed, and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn, and within five days, 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries. 
 Within two weeks, I had 150 people wanting to join in. 
 Within Japan, by July, we'd branched out to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata, further north to a town called Yamada. 
 Once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up, where people were reclaiming their photos. 
 The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before, but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo, they could give it to us, have it scanned, uploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded by a gaijin, a stranger, somewhere on the other side of the globe, and it'd start being fixed. 
 The time it took, however, to get it back is a completely different story, and it depended obviously on the damage involved. 
 It could take an hour. It could take weeks. 
 It could take months. 
 The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn, or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn't damaged. 
 It was very time-consuming. 
 Now, all these photos had been damaged by water, submerged in salt water, covered in bacteria, in sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time is going to continue to damage them, so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project. 
 We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned, dry and reclaimed. 
 Now, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning. 
 We had an amazing local woman who guided us. 
 It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos. 
 As my team leader Wynne once said, it's like doing a tattoo on someone. 
 You don't get a chance to mess it up. 
 The lady who brought us these photos was lucky, as far as the photos go. 
 She had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage. 
 She also had duplicates. 
 Areas like her husband and her face, which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix, we could just put them together in one good photo, and remake the whole photo. 
 When she collected the photos from us, she shared a bit of her story with us. 
 Her photos were found by her husband's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood, and they'd recognized him. 
 The day of the tsunami, he'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed. 
 He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded. 
 Her two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys were both at school, separate schools. 
 One of them got caught up in the water. 
 It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived. 
 The day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son's 14th birthday. 
 For her, despite all of this, those photos were the perfect gift back to him, something he could look at again, something he remembered from before that wasn't still scarred from that day in March when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed. 
 After six months in Japan, 1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands, hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean over 135,000 photographs, the large majority 
 a large majority of which did actually find their home again, importantly. 
 Over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back, fully restored and retouched. 
 During this time, we hadn't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials, most of which was printer inks. 
 We take photos constantly. 
 A photo is a reminder of someone or something, a place, a relationship, a loved one. 
 They're our memory-keepers and our histories, the last thing we would grab and the first thing you'd go back to look for. 
 That's all this project was about, about restoring those little bits of humanity, giving someone that connection back. 
 When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this, it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it. 
 The project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers. 
 For some of them, it's given them a connection to something bigger, giving something back, using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin. 
 I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them, Cindy, the day I finally got back from Japan after six months. 
 "As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images. 
 One in particular, a photo of women of all ages, from grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby, struck a chord, because a similar photo from my family, my grandmother and mother, myself, and newborn daughter, hangs on our wall. 
 Across the globe, throughout the ages, our basic needs are just the same, aren't they?" 
 Thank you. 
 I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question, which has an equally disturbing answer. 
 My topic is the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks: Why does she stay? 
 Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her? 
 I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker or an expert in domestic violence. 
 I'm just one woman with a story to tell. 
 I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College. 
 I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine. 
 I had my first apartment, my first little green American Express card, and I had a very big secret. 
 My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate, many, many times. 
 The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember. 
 I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love, a psychological trap disguised as love, one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year. 
 It may even be your story. 
 I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor. 
 I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College, an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School. 
 I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post. 
 I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together. 
 My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. 
 So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races, all religions, all income and education levels. 
 It's everywhere. 
 And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women, that it's a women's issue. 
 Not exactly. 
 Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships, in other words, in families, the last place we would want or expect to find violence, which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing. 
 I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me, but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age. 
 I was 22, and in the United States, women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages, and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners, boyfriends, and husbands in the United States. 
 I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns. 
 I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night. 
 He sat next to me on the New York City subway, and he started chatting me up. 
 He told me two things. 
 One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school, and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank. 
 But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy. 
 He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks and this wheat-blond hair, and he seemed so sweet. 
 One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship. 
 He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me. 
 We started dating, and he loved everything about me, that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard, that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job. 
 He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams. 
 Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman, in a way that no one else ever had. 
 And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret, which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four, he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather, and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade, even though he was very smart, and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life. 
 Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him. 
 If you had told me that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup, how short my skirts were, where I lived, what jobs I took, who my friends were and where I spent Christmas, I would have laughed at you, because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning. 
 I didn't know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim. 
 I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim. 
 Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce, "You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great, but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you" — — "so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises." 
 Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day, his dream job, and he said that he had quit his job because of me, because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore, and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family, and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side. 
 Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York, and my dream job, but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate, so I agreed, and I quit my job, and Conor and I left Manhattan together. 
 I had no idea I was falling into crazy love, that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical, financial and psychological trap. 
 The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts. 
 And here's where those guns come in. 
 As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns. 
 He kept one in the glove compartment of our car. 
 He kept one under the pillows on our bed, and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times. 
 And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy. 
 He needed them to feel protected. 
 But those guns were really a message for me, and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me, my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day. 
 Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding. 
 It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown. 
 I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment, and I got frustrated, and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream, and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall. 
 Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded, and I put on my mother's wedding dress, and I married him. 
 Despite what had happened, I was sure we were going to live happily ever after, because I loved him, and he loved me so much. 
 And he was very, very sorry. 
 He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me. 
 It was an isolated incident, and he was never going to hurt me again. 
 It happened twice more on the honeymoon. 
 The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost, and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver's side window. 
 And then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon, he got frustrated by traffic, and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face. 
 Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage. 
 I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation. 
 One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life, and the CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year, 15 million. 
 So actually, I was in very good company. 
 Back to my question: Why did I stay? 
 The answer is easy. 
 I didn't know he was abusing me. 
 Even though he held those loaded guns to my head, pushed me down stairs, threatened to kill our dog, pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway, poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview, I never once thought of myself as a battered wife. 
 Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man, and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons. 
 The other question everybody asks is, why doesn't she just leave? 
 Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time. 
 To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask, because we victims know something you usually don't: It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser. 
 Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her. 
 Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship, after she's gotten out, because then the abuser has nothing left to lose. 
 Other outcomes include long-term stalking, even after the abuser remarries; denial of financial resources; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children, who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother. 
 And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave? 
 I was able to leave, because of one final, sadistic beating that broke through my denial. 
 I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him. 
 So I broke the silence. 
 I told everyone: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, total strangers, and I'm here today because you all helped me. 
 We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines, self-destructive women, damaged goods. 
 The question, "Why does she stay?" 
 is code for some people for, "It's her fault for staying," as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us. 
 But since publishing "Crazy Love," I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out, who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened, and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives -- as employees, wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like me. 
 Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor. 
 I remarried a kind and gentle man, and we have those three kids. 
 I have that black lab, and I have that minivan. 
 What I will never have again, ever, is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me. 
 Right now, maybe you're thinking, "Wow, this is fascinating," or, "Wow, how stupid was she," but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you. 
 I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves. 
 Abuse could be affecting your daughter, your sister, your best friend right now. 
 I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence. 
 I'm still breaking the silence today. 
 It's my way of helping other victims, and it's my final request of you. 
 Talk about what you heard here. 
 Abuse thrives only in silence. 
 You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it. 
 We victims need everyone. 
 We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence. 
 Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children, your coworkers, your friends and family. 
 Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people with full futures. 
 Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene, deescalate it, show victims a safe way out. 
 Together we can make our beds, our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be. 
 Thank you. 
 I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals. 
 There are 10,000 species of birds in the world. 
 Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds. 
 When you see a vulture like this, the first thing that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly, greedy creatures that are just after your flesh, associated with politicians. 
 I want to change that perception. I want to change those feelings you have for these birds, because they need our sympathy. They really do. 
 And I'll tell you why. 
 First of all, why do they have such a bad press? 
 When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832 on the Beagle, he saw the turkey vulture, and he said, "These are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity." 
 You could not get a worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin. 
 You know, he changed his mind when he came back, and I'll tell you why. 
 They've also be associated with Disney — — personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters. 
 More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press — — these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that. 
 I want to challenge that. Do you know why? 
 Because MPs do not keep the environment clean. 
 MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases. 
 They are hardly monogamous. 
 They are far from being extinct. 
 And, my favorite is, vultures are better looking. 
 So there's two types of vultures in this planet. 
 There are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras, and then the Old World vultures, where we have 16 species. From these 16, 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction. 
 So why are vultures important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services. They clean up. 
 They're our natural garbage collectors. 
 They clean up carcasses right to the bone. 
 They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals. 
 Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose, and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases. 
 Vultures also have tremendous historical significance. 
 They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture. 
 Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood, and together with the cobra, symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt. 
 In Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god, and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the 10-headed demon Ravana. 
 In Tibetan culture, they are performing very important sky burials. In places like Tibet, there are no places to bury the dead, or wood to cremate them, so these vultures provide a natural disposal system. 
 So what is the problem with vultures? 
 We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya, of which six are highly threatened with extinction. 
 The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason that they're getting poisoned is because there's human-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators, and in return, the vultures are falling victim to this. 
 In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered, which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct, and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac. 
 This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India, and they have taken a stand. 
 Because there are no vultures, there's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites, and when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb of rabies. The number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India. 
 Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa: 353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana. 
 I am not against wind energy, but we need to work with the governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They slice them in half. 
 They are bird-blending machines. 
 In West Africa, there's a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market. 
 So what's being done? Well, we're conducting research on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them. 
 We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go. 
 We can see that they travel different countries, so if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you. 
 We need to work with governments in regional levels. 
 We're working with local communities. 
 We're talking to them about appreciating vultures, about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide. 
 How can you help? You can become active, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time to spread the word. Spread the word. 
 When you walk out of this room, you will be informed about vultures, but speak to your families, to your children, to your neighbors about vultures. 
 They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies. 
 Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species. 
 Thank you very much. 
 You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road. 
 It's made of asphalt, and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on, but not always, especially not on these days as today, when it's raining a lot. 
 Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt. 
 And especially if you then ride with your bicycle, and pass these cars, then that's not very nice. 
 Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise. 
 It's a noisy material, and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, then we would like a silent road. 
 The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt. 
 Porous asphalt, a material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands, it has pores and water can just rain through it, so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides, and you have a road that's easy to drive on, so no splash water anymore. 
 Also the noise will disappear in these pores. 
 Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road. 
 It also has disadvantages, of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur. 
 What is raveling? You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off. 
 First you get one stone, then several more, and more and more and more and more, and then they -- well, I will not do that. 
 But they can damage your windshield, so you're not happy with that. 
 And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage. 
 Sometimes you can create potholes with that. 
 Ha. He's ready. 
 Potholes, of course, that can become a problem, but we have a solution. 
 Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material. 
 It's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones. 
 Due to weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation, this binder, this bitumen, the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink, and if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks, and it delaminates from the aggregates. 
 Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates -- what we just saw here. 
 To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials. 
 If we can make this material self-healing, then probably we have a solution. 
 So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans, and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces, and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen. 
 So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it. 
 Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine. 
 Induction can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that. 
 Then what you do is you heat up the steel, you melt the bitumen, and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks, and the stones are again fixed to the surface. 
 Today I use a microwave because I cannot take the big induction machine here onstage. 
 So a microwave is a similar system. 
 So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out to see what happened. 
 So this is the specimen coming out now. 
 So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens. 
 We tested a lot of specimens there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that." 
 So they donated to us a piece of highway, 400 meters of the A58, where we had to make a test track to test this material. 
 So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road, and then of course this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know from practice. 
 So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab. 
 So we did aging on the samples, did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine, and healed them and tested them again. 
 Several times we can repeat that. 
 So actually, the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road, which of course saves a lot of money. 
 Well, to conclude, I can say that we made a material using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers, using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road, double the surface life you can even do, so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks. 
 And now you're of course curious if it also worked. 
 So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm. 
 Actually, it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works. 
 But I will do a trial. 
 Let's see. Yeah, it worked. 
 Thank you. 
 When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet, and I grew up singing a song called "Nothing To Envy." 
 And I was very proud. 
 In school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung, but we never learned much about the outside world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies. 
 Although I often wondered about the outside world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything suddenly changed. 
 When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution, but I thought my life in North Korea was normal. 
 My family was not poor, and myself, I had never experienced hunger. 
 But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from a coworker's sister. 
 It read, "When you read this, all five family members will not exist in this world, because we haven't eaten for the past two weeks. 
 We are lying on the floor together, and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die." 
 I was so shocked. 
 This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering. 
 Soon after, when I was walking past a train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory. 
 A lifeless woman was lying on the ground, while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother's face. 
 But nobody helped them, because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families. 
 A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s. 
 Ultimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine, and many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark. 
 Power outages also became more and more frequent, so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China, just across the river from my home. 
 I always wondered why they had lights but we didn't. 
 This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors. 
 This is the Amrok River, which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China. 
 As you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points, allowing North Koreans to secretly cross. 
 But many die. 
 Sometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river. 
 I can't reveal many details [about] how I left North Korea, but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives. 
 But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time. 
 I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together. 
 In China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family. 
 I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee, but I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult, it's also very dangerous, since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants. 
 So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed, and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea. 
 One day, my worst nightmare came true, when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation. 
 Someone had accused me of being North Korean, so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions. 
 I was so scared, I thought my heart was going to explode. 
 If anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned and repatriated. 
 I thought my life was over, but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions. 
 After they finished questioning me, one official said to another, "This was a false report. 
 She's not North Korean." 
 And they let me go. It was a miracle. 
 Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies, but many can be caught by the Chinese police and repatriated. 
 These girls were so lucky. 
 Even though they were caught, they were eventually released after heavy international pressure. 
 These North Koreans were not so lucky. 
 Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea, where they can be tortured, imprisoned or publicly executed. 
 Even though I was really fortunate to get out, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky. 
 It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive. 
 Even after learning a new language and getting a job, their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant. 
 That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South Korea, and I started a new life yet again. 
 Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected. 
 English was so important in South Korea, so I had to start learning my third language. 
 Also, I realized there was a wide gap between North and South. 
 We are all Korean, but inside, we have become very different due to 67 years of division. 
 I even went through an identity crisis. 
 Am I South Korean or North Korean? 
 Where am I from? Who am I? 
 Suddenly, there was no country I could proudly call my own. 
 Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. 
 I started studying for the university entrance exam. 
 Just as I was starting to get used to my new life, I received a shocking phone call. 
 The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family, and, as a punishment, my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside. 
 They had to get out quickly, so I started planning how to help them escape. 
 North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom. 
 It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, so, ironically, I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border. 
 Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, somehow, through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia. 
 The journey by bus took one week, and we were almost caught several times. 
 One time, our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer. 
 He took everyone's I.D. cards, and he started asking them questions. 
 Since my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested. 
 As the Chinese officer approached my family, I impulsively stood up, and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning. 
 He looked at me suspiciously, but luckily he believed me. 
 We made it all the way to the border of Laos, but I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos. 
 But even after we got past the border, my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing. 
 After I paid the fine and bribe, my family was released in one month, but soon after, my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of Laos. 
 This was one of the lowest points in my life. 
 I did everything to get my family to freedom, and we came so close, but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy. 
 I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to get my family out, but I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore. 
 I lost all hope. 
 At that moment, I heard one man's voice ask me, "What's wrong?" 
 I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask. 
 In my broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without hesitating, the man went to the ATM and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get out of jail. 
 I thanked him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why are you helping me?" 
 "I'm not helping you," he said. 
 "I'm helping the North Korean people." 
 I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life. 
 The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need. 
 Eventually, after our long journey, my family and I were reunited in South Korea, but getting to freedom is only half the battle. 
 Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they arrive in a new country, they start with little or no money. 
 So we can benefit from the international community for education, English language training, job training, and more. 
 We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world, because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside. 
 I've been so lucky, received so much help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support. 
 I'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world, including the TED stage. 
 Thank you. 
 So, well, I do applied math, and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math, is that we are like management consultants. 
 No one knows what the hell we do. 
 So I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do. 
 So, dancing is one of the most human of activities. 
 We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on. 
 Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill, and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it. 
 Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability, as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time. 
 So great progress and treatment has been made over the years. 
 However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease, and they have to live with incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease, so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late. 
 We need to be able to measure progression objectively, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure. 
 But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers, so there's no simple blood test that you can do, and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test. 
 You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, it's just never done. It's never done. 
 But what if patients could do this test at home? 
 Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic, and what if patients could do that test themselves, right? 
 No expensive staff time required. 
 Takes about $300, by the way, in the neurologist's clinic to do it. 
 So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this, because, you see, in one sense, at least, we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling. 
 So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds. 
 Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds, and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds, and we all actually have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example. 
 And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training. 
 I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak. 
 From the sound, we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates, and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's, so too are the vocal organs. 
 So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor. 
 We see all the same symptoms. 
 We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity. 
 The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it. 
 So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle, in some cases, but with any digital microphone, and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning, which is very advanced by now, we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone. 
 So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive. 
 The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure. 
 You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it. 
 And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition, voice-based tests are non-expert. 
 That means they can be self-administered. 
 They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most. 
 They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens. 
 When something becomes ultra-low cost, it becomes massively scalable. 
 So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now. 
 We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients. 
 No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup. 
 We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data. 
 We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials, and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time. 
 We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late. 
 So, taking the first steps towards this today, we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative. 
 With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals. 
 We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet. 
 Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply, and leave recordings, a few cents each, and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours. 
 Thank you. 
 So Max, by taking all these samples of, let's say, 10,000 people, you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not? 
 What are you going to get out of those samples? 
 Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that, during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not, you see. Right. 
 You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it. 
 But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances, and it's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors, and looking for the actual markers of the disease. 
 So you're 86 percent accurate right now? 
 It's much better than that. 
 Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him, because he's done some fantastic work, and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well, which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy. 
 Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement. 
 So what that means is that people will be able to — People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in, record their voice, and then their doctor can check up on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease. 
 Absolutely. 
 Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody. 
 Thanks, Tom. 
 I'm 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana. 
 The air is thick with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe. 
 I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness, but I can't see much else. 
 I hear voices talking, but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing, and stone being broken with primitive tools. 
 Like the others, I wear a flickering, cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic, tattered band, and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth. 
 When my hand slips, I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft. 
 As I stand talking to you today, these men are still deep in that hole, risking their lives without payment or compensation, and often dying. 
 I got to climb out of that hole, and I got to go home, but they likely never will, because they're trapped in slavery. 
 For the last 28 years, I've been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit. 
 Amongst all the astonishing people I met there, I met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery. 
 We started talking about slavery, and really, I started learning about slavery, for I had certainly known it existed in the world, but not to such a degree. 
 After we finished talking, I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime, and I thought, if I don't know, how many other people don't know? 
 It started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks, I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help. 
 Thus began my journey into modern day slavery. 
 Oddly, I had been to many of these places before. 
 Some I even considered like my second home. 
 But this time, I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet. 
 A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today. 
 That's double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade. 
 A hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker. 
 That equates to about $50,000 in today's money. 
 Yet today, entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $18. 
 Astonishingly, slavery generates profits of more than $13 billion worldwide each year. 
 Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education, a better job, only to find that they're forced to work without pay under the threat of violence, and they cannot walk away. 
 Today's slavery is about commerce, so the goods that enslaved people produce have value, but the people producing them are disposable. 
 Slavery exists everywhere, nearly, in the world, and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world. 
 In India and Nepal, I was introduced to the brick kilns. 
 This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno. 
 Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees, men, women, children, entire families in fact, were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust, while mechanically stacking bricks on their head, up to 18 at a time, and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away. 
 Deadened by monotony and exhaustion, they work silently, doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day. 
 There were no breaks for food, no water breaks, and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential. 
 So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working. 
 Every 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it, and as I sat there, I thought, my camera is getting far better treatment than these people. 
 Back in the kilns, I wanted to cry, but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said, "Lisa, don't do that. Just don't do that here." 
 And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this, not just for me, but for them. 
 I couldn't offer them any direct help. 
 I couldn't give them money, nothing. 
 I wasn't a citizen of that country. 
 I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in. 
 I'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation, and I trusted that they would. 
 As for me, I'd have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak. 
 In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below. 
 The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them, and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth. 
 It's difficult to witness something so overwhelming. 
 How can we affect something so insidious, yet so pervasive? 
 Some don't even know they're enslaved, people working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay, because this has been the case all their lives. 
 They have nothing to compare it to. 
 When these villagers claimed their freedom, the slaveholders burned down all of their houses. 
 I mean, these people had nothing, and they were so petrified, they wanted to give up, but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere, and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own, so that now they do the same back-breaking work, but they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it, and they do it in freedom. 
 Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery, and because of this worldwide awareness, I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry. 
 In Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves. 
 They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty, dimly fluorescent lit basement. 
 This wasn't a brothel, per se. 
 It was more like a restaurant. 
 Cabin restaurants, as they're known in the trade, are venues for forced prostitution. 
 Each has small, private rooms, where the slaves, women, along with young girls and boys, some as young as seven years old, are forced to entertain the clients, encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol. 
 Each cubicle is dark and dingy, identified with a painted number on the wall, and partitioned by plywood and a curtain. 
 The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers. 
 Standing in the near darkness, I remember feeling this quick, hot fear, and in that instant, I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell. 
 I had only one way out: the stairs from where I'd come in. 
 There were no back doors. 
 There were no windows large enough to climb through. 
 These people have no escape at all, and as we take in such a difficult subject, it's important to note that slavery, including sex trafficking, occurs in our own backyard as well. 
 Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture, in restaurants, in domestic servitude, and the list can go on. 
 Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year. 
 It's all around us. We just don't see it. 
 The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor. 
 I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade. 
 This is a family portrait. 
 The dyed black hands are the father, while the blue and red hands are his sons. 
 They mix dye in these big barrels, and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows, but the dye is toxic. 
 My interpreter told me their stories. 
 "We have no freedom," they said. 
 "We hope still, though, that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing." 
 It's estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta, the largest man-made lake in the world. 
 When we first arrived, I went to have a quick look. 
 I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense right? 
 Wrong. They were all enslaved. 
 Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished, and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake, even though they do not know how to swim. 
 This young child is eight years old. 
 He was trembling when our boat approached, frightened it would run over his tiny canoe. 
 He was petrified he would be knocked in the water. 
 The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets, and weary, frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines. 
 Many of them drown. 
 For as long as he can recall, he's been forced to work on the lake. 
 Terrified of his master, he will not run away, and since he's been treated with cruelty all his life, he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages. 
 I met these boys at five in the morning, when they were hauling in the last of their nets, but they had been working since 1 a.m. 
 in the cold, windy night. 
 And it's important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish. 
 I want to introduce you to Kofi. 
 Kofi was rescued from a fishing village. 
 I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery. 
 Here he's seen taking a bath at the well, pouring big buckets of water over his head, and the wonderful news is, as you and I are sitting here talking today, Kofi has been reunited with his family, and what's even better, his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe. 
 Kofi is the embodiment of possibility. 
 Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life? 
 Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves, a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window. 
 He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle. 
 At the end of the road, he urged us out of the car, and told the driver to quickly leave. 
 Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath, and said, "This is the path, this is the path. Go." 
 As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in, found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains, so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest. 
 After another two hours of hiking, the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing, and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field, and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring. 
 Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold, wading in water poisoned by mercury. 
 Mercury is used in the extraction process. 
 These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana. 
 When they came out of the shaft, they were soaking wet from their own sweat. 
 I remember looking into their tired, bloodshot eyes, for many of them had been underground for 72 hours. 
 The shafts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area, where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold. 
 At first glance, the pounding site seems full of powerful men, but when we look closer, we see some less fortunate working on the fringes, and children too. 
 All of them are victim to injury, illness and violence. 
 In fact, it's very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here, racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years. 
 This is Manuru. When his father died, his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines. 
 When his uncle died, Manuru inherited his uncle's debt, which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines. 
 When I met him, he had been working in the mines for 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident, one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated. 
 On top of that, Manuru has tuberculosis, yet he's still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft. 
 Even still, he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves, and it's this sort of determination, in the face of unimaginable odds, that fills me with complete awe. 
 I want to shine a light on slavery. 
 When I was working in the field, I brought lots of candles with me, and with the help of my interpreter, I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight, so when it was safe for them, and safe for me, I made these images. 
 They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world. 
 I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them, and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives. 
 I truly believe, if we can see one another as fellow human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery. 
 These images are not of issues. They are of people, real people, like you and me, all deserving of the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives. 
 There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of these many beautiful, mistreated people I've had the tremendous honor of meeting. 
 I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them, people like you, and I hope that force will ignite a fire, and that fire will shine a light on slavery, for without that light, the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows. 
 Thank you very much. 
 There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives. 
 We don't bump into every neighbor, so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on, though we do share the same public spaces. 
 So over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space, using simple tools like stickers, stencils and chalk. 
 And these projects came from questions I had, like, how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments? 
 How can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other's doors at a bad time? 
 How can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings, and gain a better understanding of our landscape? 
 And how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts, so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today? 
 Now, I live in New Orleans, and I am in love with New Orleans. 
 My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees, shading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years, and I trust a city that always makes way for music. 
 I feel like every time someone sneezes, New Orleans has a parade. 
 The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America. 
 I live near this house, and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever. 
 In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much. 
 Her name was Joan, and she was a mother to me, and her death was sudden and unexpected. 
 And I thought about death a lot, and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had, and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now. 
 But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life. 
 I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, and forget what really matters to you. 
 So with help from old and new friends, I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence: "Before I die, I want to ... " So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk, reflect on their lives, and share their personal aspirations in public space. 
 I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out, and it kept growing. 
 And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall. 
 "Before I die, I want to be tried for piracy." 
 "Before I die, I want to straddle the International Date Line." 
 "Before I die, I want to sing for millions." 
 "Before I die, I want to plant a tree." 
 "Before I die, I want to live off the grid." 
 "Before I die, I want to hold her one more time." 
 "Before I die, I want to be someone's cavalry." 
 "Before I die, I want to be completely myself." 
 So this neglected space became a constructive one, and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud, tear up, and they consoled me during my own tough times. 
 It's about knowing you're not alone. 
 It's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways. 
 It's about making space for reflection and contemplation, and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change. 
 I made this last year, and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community, so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit, and now walls have been made in countries around the world, including Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond. 
 Together, we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we're given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another. 
 Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people. 
 In our age of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender. 
 Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about or even think about, but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. 
 Thinking about death clarifies your life. 
 Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community, and with more ways to share our hopes, fears and stories, the people around us can not only help us make better places, they can help us lead better lives. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera, but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine, and I didn't take any of them. 
 There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting. 
 In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists. 
 My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement, and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th. 
 We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture. 
 Well you can see where this is going. 
 Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?" 
 This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. 
 You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger. 
 No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera. 
 Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives. 
 It's really become sacred to us. 
 This one was taken just weeks after 9/11, and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand. 
 So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment, or even a specific trip. 
 They're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year, and not just physically, but in every way. 
 Because while we take the same photo, our perspectives change, and she reaches new milestones, and I get to see life through her eyes, and how she interacts with and sees everything. 
 This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year. 
 Recently, on one trip, we were walking, and she stops dead in her tracks, and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips. 
 And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot. 
 She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier. 
 And now what she's looking at in New York are colleges, because she's determined to go to school in New York. 
 And it hit me: One of the most important things we all make are memories. 
 So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories. 
 I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots, I'm not in many of the family photos. 
 I'm always the one taking the picture. 
 So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot, and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask, "Will you take our picture?" 
 Thank you.
