 One day, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music. 
 And the source was a man, an African-American man, charming, rugged, homeless, playing a violin that only had two strings. 
 And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Steve's columns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movie, with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. 
 Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown, and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. 
 I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men, but how music helped shape that bond, and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun -- in helping Nathaniel get off the streets. 
 I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall. 
 He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies, and came backstage and introduced himself. 
 He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series, all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. 
 And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. 
 Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. 
 But as a result now, he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes, the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days, wandering the streets of Skid Row, exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him. 
 And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall -- he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes, he was lost. 
 And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke, and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. 
 And I was afraid, not for myself, but I was afraid that I was going to lose him, that he was going to sink into one of his states, and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. 
 So, I just started playing. 
 And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. 
 And as I played, I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. 
 It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical, a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music was its catalyst. 
 And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding, a quiet curiosity and grace. 
 And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin and he started playing, by ear, certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius. 
 And we started talking about music, from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B's, from Bart√≥k, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen. 
 And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music, but he related to this music at a personal level. 
 He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
 And through playing music and talking about music, this man had transformed from the paranoid, disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, erudite, brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician. 
 Music is medicine. Music changes us. 
 And for Nathaniel, music is sanity. 
 Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity, into reality. 
 And that is an escape from his tormented state. 
 And I understood that this was the very essence of art. 
 This was the very reason why we made music, that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core, our emotions, and through our artistic lens, through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality. 
 And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us, inspires and unites us. 
 And for Nathaniel, music brought him back into a fold of friends. 
 The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him, that recognized his talents and respected him. 
 And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician. 
 Thank you. 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks. 
 Robert Gupta. 
 Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. 
 So, please forgive me. 
 So, I've known a lot of fish in my life. 
 I've loved only two. 
 That first one, it was more like a passionate affair. 
 It was a beautiful fish: flavorful, textured, meaty, a bestseller on the menu. 
 What a fish. 
 Even better, it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. 
 So you could feel good about selling it. 
 I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. 
 One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability. 
 "Absolutely," I said. 
 Here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs: How do we keep fish on our menus? 
 For the past 50 years, we've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests. 
 It's hard to overstate the destruction. 
 Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love -- the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish -- they've collapsed. 
 There's almost nothing left. 
 So, for better or for worse, aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future. 
 A lot of arguments against it: Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they're inefficient. Take tuna, a major drawback. 
 It's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one. 
 That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. 
 Not very sustainable. 
 It doesn't taste very good either. 
 So here, finally, was a company trying to do it right. 
 I wanted to support them. 
 The day before the event, I called the head of P.R. for the company. 
 Let's call him Don. 
 "Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute." 
 "That's right," he said. "We're so far out, the waste from our fish gets distributed, not concentrated." 
 And then he added, "We're basically a world unto ourselves. 
 That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said. 
 "Best in the business." 
 2.5 to one, great. 
 "2.5 what? What are you feeding?" 
 "Sustainable proteins," he said. 
 "Great," I said. Got off the phone. 
 And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought: What the hell is a sustainable protein? 
 So the next day, just before the event, I called Don. 
 I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" 
 He said he didn't know. He would ask around. 
 Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company; no one could give me a straight answer until finally, I got on the phone with the head biologist. 
 Let's call him Don too. 
 "Don," I said, "what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" 
 Well, he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals, and then he said chicken pellets. 
 I said, "Chicken pellets?" 
 He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin, bone meal, scraps, dried and processed into feed." 
 I said, "What percentage of your feed is chicken?" 
 Thinking, you know, two percent. 
 "Well, it's about 30 percent," he said. 
 I said, "Don, what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish?" 
 There was a long pause on the line, and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world." 
 I fell out of love with this fish. 
 No, not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two shoes foodie. 
 I actually am. 
 No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God, after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken. 
 This second fish, it's a different kind of love story. 
 It's the romantic kind, the kind where the more you get to know your fish, you love the fish. 
 I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain. 
 A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. 
 She kind of set us up. 
 It came to the table a bright, almost shimmering, white color. 
 The chef had overcooked it. 
 Like twice over. 
 Amazingly, it was still delicious. 
 Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked? 
 I can't, but this guy can. 
 Let's call him Miguel -- actually his name is Miguel. 
 And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef, at least in the way that you and I understand it. 
 He's a biologist at Veta La Palma. 
 It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. 
 It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river. 
 Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. 
 They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. 
 They did it by draining the land. 
 They built this intricate series of canals, and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. 
 Well, they couldn't make it work, not economically. 
 And ecologically, it was a disaster. 
 It killed like 90 percent of the birds, which, for this place, is a lot of birds. 
 And so in 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. 
 What did they do? 
 They reversed the flow of water. 
 They literally flipped the switch. 
 Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in. 
 They flooded the canals. 
 They created a 27,000-acre fish farm -- bass, mullet, shrimp, eel -- and in the process, Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction. 
 The farm's incredible. 
 I mean, you've never seen anything like this. 
 You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away, and all you see are flooded canals and this thick, rich marshland. 
 I was there not long ago with Miguel. 
 He's an amazing guy, like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. 
 Okay? There we are slogging through the wetlands, and I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees, and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture. 
 Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite. 
 Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. 
 And here, here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. 
 It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. 
 I asked him how he became such an expert on fish. 
 He said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish. 
 I'm an expert in relationships." 
 And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants. 
 And don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know, the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing. 
 It's great, but I was in love. 
 And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. 
 So I interrupted him. I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?" 
 He pointed at the algae. 
 "I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton, the relationships: It's amazing. 
 But what are your fish eating? 
 What's the feed conversion ratio?" 
 Well, he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild. 
 The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish. 
 The system is so healthy, it's totally self-renewing. 
 There is no feed. 
 Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals? 
 Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel, and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural, unlike like any farm I'd ever been at, how do you measure success?" 
 At that moment, it was as if a film director called for a set change. 
 And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight: thousands and thousands of pink flamingos, a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see. 
 "That's success," he said. 
 "Look at their bellies, pink. 
 They're feasting." 
 Feasting? I was totally confused. 
 I said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?" 
 "Yes," he said. 
 "We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. 
 Well, last year, this property had 600,000 birds on it, more than 250 different species. 
 It's become, today, the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe." 
 I said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm?" 
 He shook his head, no. 
 He said, "We farm extensively, not intensively. 
 This is an ecological network. 
 The flamingos eat the shrimp. 
 The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. 
 So the pinker the belly, the better the system." 
 Okay, so let's review: a farm that doesn't feed its animals, and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators. 
 A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary. 
 Oh, and by the way, those flamingos, they shouldn't even be there in the first place. 
 They brood in a town 150 miles away, where the soil conditions are better for building nests. 
 Every morning, they fly 150 miles into the farm. 
 And every evening, they fly 150 miles back. 
 They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A92. 
 No kidding. 
 I was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing, so I looked at Miguel. 
 I said, "Miguel, do they fly 150 miles to the farm, and then do they fly 150 miles back at night? 
 Do they do that for the children?" 
 He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song. 
 He said, "No; they do it because the food's better." 
 I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish, which was delicious -- and I don't like fish skin; I don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy. 
 It's that acrid, tar-like flavor. 
 I almost never cook with it. 
 Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain, it tasted not at all like fish skin. 
 It tasted sweet and clean, like you were taking a bite of the ocean. 
 I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded. 
 He said, "The skin acts like a sponge. 
 It's the last defense before anything enters the body. 
 It evolved to soak up impurities." 
 And then he added, "But our water has no impurities." 
 OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish, a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators. 
 And then I realized when he says, "A farm that has no impurities," he made a big understatement, because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River. 
 It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days: chemical contaminants, pesticide runoff. 
 And when it works its way through the system and leaves, the water is cleaner than when it entered. 
 The system is so healthy, it purifies the water. 
 So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals, not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators, but a farm that's literally a water purification plant -- and not just for those fish, but for you and me as well. 
 Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic. 
 A drop in the ocean, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you, because this love story, however romantic, is also instructive. 
 You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food, whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle. 
 What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture, one in which the food actually tastes good. 
 But for a lot people, that's a bit too radical. 
 We're not realists, us foodies; we're lovers. 
 We love farmers' markets, we love small family farms, we talk about local food, we eat organic. 
 And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food, someone, somewhere stands up and says, "Hey guy, I love pink flamingos, but how are you going to feed the world?" 
 How are you going to feed the world? 
 Can I be honest? 
 I don't love that question. 
 No, not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world. 
 One billion people will go hungry today. 
 One billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of gross inequalities in distribution, not tonnage. 
 Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years. 
 Feed grain to herbivores, pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil, chicken to fish, and all along agribusiness has simply asked, "If we're feeding more people more cheaply, how terrible could that be?" 
 That's been the motivation, it's been the justification: it's been the business plan of American agriculture. 
 We should call it what it is: a business in liquidation, a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible. 
 That's not a business, and it isn't agriculture. 
 Our breadbasket is threatened today, not because of diminishing supply, but because of diminishing resources. 
 Not by the latest combine and tractor invention, but by fertile land; not by pumps, but by fresh water; not by chainsaws, but by forests; and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea. 
 Want to feed the world? 
 Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves? 
 Or better: How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself? 
 To do that, don't look at the agribusiness model for the future. 
 It's really old, and it's tired. 
 It's high on capital, chemistry and machines, and it's never produced anything really good to eat. 
 Instead, let's look to the ecological model. 
 That's the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience. 
 Look to Miguel, farmers like Miguel. 
 Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves; farms that restore instead of deplete; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively; farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships. 
 Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor, too. 
 And if I'm going to be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be. 
 You know, I'm okay with that, because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious. 
 Thank you. 
 If I can leave you with one big idea today, it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts, and instead of thinking about information overload, what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible. 
 So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age. 
 This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment. 
 It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents. 
 And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges. 
 This is because, in the mid-area here, people are at their most active, and over here they're at their most frail. 
 We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death, seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects, but not for everyone. 
 If we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about. 
 And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men. 
 So you get the idea that viewing information, viewing data in this way, is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic. 
 And if we can do this for raw data, why not do it for content as well? 
 So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced. 
 It's all here; it's all on the web. 
 You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk. 
 With Pivot, you can drill into a decade. 
 You can drill into a particular year. 
 You can jump right into a specific issue. 
 So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue, the sports. 
 I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that, which reveals, for me, all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of. 
 Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these, I might think, "Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?" 
 So I can step back, and expand on that. 
 And I see Greg LeMond now. 
 And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way -- going narrower, broader, backing in, backing out -- you're not searching, you're not browsing. 
 You're doing something that's actually a little bit different. 
 It's in between, and we think it changes the way information can be used. 
 So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy. 
 What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary. 
 So the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from. 
 I'm only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here. 
 But even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things. 
 Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia. 
 I'm going to go ahead and select government. 
 Now, having selected government, I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year. 
 So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page. 
 It's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them. 
 Looking at one of these particular summaries, I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year, bringing up all of them. 
 So looking at these people, I can see that the majority come from government; some have come from natural sciences; some, fewer still, have come from business -- there's my boss -- and one has come from music. 
 And interestingly enough, Bono is also a TED Prize winner. 
 So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners. 
 So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page, but at a higher level of abstraction. 
 And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise. 
 I'm just showing the New York Times website here. 
 So Pivot, this application -- I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser, but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this. 
 So I can step back, pop right back into a specific section. 
 Now the reason why this is important is because, by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way, I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way. 
 So I can drill into what I've done over specific time frames. 
 Here, in fact, is the state of all the demo that I just gave. 
 And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today. 
 And, if I want to step back and look at everything, I can slice and dice my history, perhaps by my search history -- here, I was doing some nepotistic searching, looking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot. 
 And from these, I can drill into the web page and just launch them again. 
 It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times, and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data. 
 So right now, in this world, we think about data as being this curse. 
 We talk about the curse of information overload. 
 We talk about drowning in data. 
 What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down, so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next, we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things, and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden? 
 If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information. 
 And, instead of dealing just with information, we can tease out knowledge. 
 And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found. 
 So with that, I thank you. 
 I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction. 
 In high school, I took a bus to school an hour each way every day. 
 And I was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds, and satisfied, in a narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had. 
 And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school I was out in the woods, hiking and taking "samples" -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope. 
 You know, I was a real science geek. 
 But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility. 
 And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me, because what was happening, this was in the late '60s, we were going to the moon, we were exploring the deep oceans. 
 Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined. 
 So, that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it. 
 And I was an artist. 
 I could draw. I could paint. 
 And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, I had to create these images in my head. 
 You know, we all did, as kids having to read a book, and through the author's description, put something on the movie screen in our heads. 
 And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw alien creatures, alien worlds, robots, spaceships, all that stuff. 
 I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook. 
 That was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow. 
 And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth. 
 I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday -- that seemed pretty darn unlikely. 
 But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books. 
 So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15. 
 And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada, 600 miles from the nearest ocean. 
 But I didn't let that daunt me. 
 I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo, New York, right across the border from where we live. 
 And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo, New York. 
 And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean, for another two years, until we moved to California. 
 Since then, in the intervening 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 hours of that was in submersibles. 
 And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment, and even the shallow oceans, are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination. 
 Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination. 
 I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives. 
 And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing, and just as strong as it ever was. 
 But when I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking. 
 And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images. 
 And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on. 
 So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together, and that made sense. 
 And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens" and "The Abyss." 
 And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking. 
 So, you know, merging the two passions. 
 Something interesting came out of "The Abyss," which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film, which was to create this kind of liquid water creature, we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG. 
 And this resulted in the first soft-surface character, CG animation that was ever in a movie. 
 And even though the film didn't make any money -- barely broke even, I should say -- I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience, the global audience, was mesmerized by this apparent magic. 
 You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. 
 They were seeing something magical. 
 And so that got me very excited. 
 And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art." 
 So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film, we took that much farther. 
 Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude in that film. The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work. 
 And it did, and we created magic again, and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one. 
 So, drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to, "This is going to be a whole new world," this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists. 
 So, I started a company with Stan Winston, my good friend Stan Winston, who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time, and it was called Digital Domain. 
 And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on, and we would go right to digital production. 
 And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. 
 But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do. 
 So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar," which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects, of CG effects, beyond, with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG, and the main characters would all be in CG, and the world would be in CG. 
 And the envelope pushed back, and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. 
 So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks. 
 You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship: "It's going to be this epic romance, passionate film." 
 Secretly, what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic." 
 And that's why I made the movie. 
 And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that. 
 But I convinced them. I said, "We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real. 
 We'll be using it in the opening of the film. 
 It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook." 
 And I talked them into funding an expedition. 
 Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality. 
 Because we actually created a reality where six months later, I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic, looking at the real Titanic through a view port. 
 Not a movie, not HD -- for real. 
 Now, that blew my mind. 
 And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. 
 But, it struck me how much this dive, these deep dives, was like a space mission. 
 You know, where it was highly technical, and it required enormous planning. 
 You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself. 
 And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like, living in a science fiction movie. 
 This is really cool." 
 And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration. 
 Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it -- it was everything. It was adventure, it was curiosity, it was imagination. 
 And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me. 
 Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window. 
 As we did some of our subsequent expeditions, I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before, sometimes things that no one had seen before, that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them. 
 So, I was completely smitten by this, and had to do more. 
 And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision. 
 After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while." 
 And so, we started planning these expeditions. 
 And we wound up going to the Bismark, and exploring it with robotic vehicles. 
 We went back to the Titanic wreck. 
 We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic. 
 And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship, which had never been done. 
 Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it, so we created technology to do it. 
 So, you know, here I am now, on the deck of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and looking out at planks that look much like this, where I knew that the band had played. 
 And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship. 
 When I say, "I'm operating it," but my mind is in the vehicle. 
 I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic. 
 And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had, because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it, because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie. 
 And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship. 
 So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience. 
 And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience -- that you actually can have these robotic avatars, then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle, into this other form of existence. 
 It was really, really quite profound. 
 And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine, as a science fiction fan. 
 So, having done these expeditions, and really beginning to appreciate what was down there, such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing, amazing animals -- they're basically aliens right here on Earth. 
 They live in an environment of chemosynthesis. 
 They don't survive on sunlight-based system the way we do. 
 And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-Centigrade water plumes. 
 You think they can't possibly exist. 
 At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid. 
 And I wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NASA, sitting on the NASA advisory board, planning actual space missions, going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems. 
 And this was fascinating. 
 But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep. 
 And taking them down so that they had access -- astrobiologists, planetary scientists, people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents, and letting them see, and take samples and test instruments, and so on. 
 So, here we were making documentary films, but actually doing science, and actually doing space science. 
 I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real. 
 And you know, along the way in this journey of discovery, I learned a lot. 
 I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about leadership. 
 Now you think director has got to be a leader, leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing. 
 I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions. 
 Because I had to, at a certain point, say, "What am I doing out here? 
 Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?" 
 We don't make money at these damn shows. 
 We barely break even. There is no fame in it. 
 People sort of think I went away between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails someplace, sitting at the beach. 
 Made all these films, made all these documentary films for a very limited audience. 
 No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing? 
 You're doing it for the task itself, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thrill of discovery, and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team. 
 Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people, working for years at a time, sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time. 
 And in that bond, you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else. 
 When you come back to the shore and you say, "We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation, and the this and the that, all the technology of it, and the difficulty, the human-performance aspects of working at sea," you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it. 
 Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect. 
 So, when I came back to make my next movie, which was "Avatar," I tried to apply that same principle of leadership, which is that you respect your team, and you earn their respect in return. 
 And it really changed the dynamic. 
 So, here I was again with a small team, in uncharted territory, doing "Avatar," coming up with new technology that didn't exist before. 
 Tremendously exciting. 
 Tremendously challenging. 
 And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period. 
 And it completely changed how I do movies. 
 So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know, you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora." 
 To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business, the process itself, that changed as a result of that. 
 So, what can we synthesize out of all this? 
 You know, what are the lessons learned? 
 Well, I think number one is curiosity. 
 It's the most powerful thing you own. 
 Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. 
 And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world. 
 I have young filmmakers come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this." 
 And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself. 
 Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself, and take risks." 
 NASA has this phrase that they like: "Failure is not an option." 
 But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith. 
 And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. 
 You have to be willing to take those risks. 
 So, that's the thought I would leave you with, is that in whatever you're doing, failure is an option, but fear is not. Thank you. 
 I'm going to talk today about energy and climate. 
 And that might seem a bit surprising because my full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds, about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. 
 But energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet. 
 The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow: There will be too much rain, not enough rain, things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support. 
 And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest. 
 So, the climate changes will be terrible for them. 
 Also, the price of energy is very important to them. 
 In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of, to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy. 
 Now, the price of energy has come down over time. 
 Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. 
 The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution, and, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity, and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning, we can make modern materials and do so many things. 
 And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. 
 But, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint, and that constraint has to do with CO2. 
 CO2 is warming the planet, and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one. 
 If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted, that leads to a temperature increase, and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects: the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects, in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collapses. 
 Now, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are, there's some uncertainty there, but not very much. 
 And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad. 
 I asked the top scientists on this several times: Do we really have to get down to near zero? 
 Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter? 
 And the answer is that until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to rise. 
 And so that's a big challenge. 
 It's very different than saying "We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge, and we can just sort of squeeze under." 
 This is something that has to get to zero. 
 Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year, over 26 billion tons. 
 For each American, it's about 20 tons; for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton. 
 It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. 
 And, somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. 
 It's been constantly going up. 
 It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all, so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero. 
 This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication: So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy. 
 So, let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero. 
 Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. 
 Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look. 
 First, we've got population. 
 The world today has 6.8 billion people. 
 That's headed up to about nine billion. 
 Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent, but there we see an increase of about 1.3. 
 The second factor is the services we use. 
 This encompasses everything: the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating. 
 These are very good things: getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. 
 And it's a great thing for this number to go up. 
 In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion, we probably could cut back and use less, but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up, and so, over all, that will more than double the services delivered per person. 
 Here we have a very basic service: Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework? 
 And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps. 
 Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service, here finally we have some good news. 
 We have something that's not going up. 
 Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting, through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially. 
 Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent. 
 There are other services like how we make fertilizer, or how we do air transport, where the rooms for improvement are far, far less. 
 And so, overall here, if we're optimistic, we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six. 
 But for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that just won't cut it. 
 So let's look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy. 
 And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero? 
 If you burn coal, no. 
 If you burn natural gas, no. 
 Almost every way we make electricity today, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2. 
 And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale, is create a new system. 
 And so, we need energy miracles. 
 Now, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible. 
 The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. 
 The Internet and its services are a miracle. 
 So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. 
 Usually, we don't have a deadline, where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. 
 Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't. 
 This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline. 
 Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this? 
 Is there some kind of natural illustration, some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?" 
 I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos, and somehow people enjoyed that. 
 It really got them involved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitos. 
 So, with energy, all I could come up with is this. 
 I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. 
 So here we have some natural fireflies. 
 I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar. 
 Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one, but they don't really add up to much. 
 We need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability, and, although there's many directions people are seeking, I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. 
 I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels. 
 Those may make some contribution, and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better, but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting, because they all have significant challenges. 
 Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels, either burning coal or burning natural gas. 
 What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not, and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue, pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere, and hope it stays there. 
 Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level, but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky, and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard, but the toughest one here is this long-term issue. 
 Who's going to be sure? 
 Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things? 
 This is a lot of volume. 
 So that's a tough one. 
 Next would be nuclear. 
 It also has three big problems: Cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high; the issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong, that, even though you have these human operators, that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. 
 And then what do you do with the waste? 
 And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that. 
 People need to feel good about it. 
 So three very tough problems that might be solvable, and so, should be worked on. 
 The last three of the five, I've grouped together. 
 These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. 
 And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel -- they have some disadvantages. 
 One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. 
 This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles, thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. 
 Also, these are intermittent sources. 
 The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day, and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time. 
 And so, if you depend on these sources, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available. 
 So, we've got big cost challenges here, we have transmission challenges: for example, say this energy source is outside your country; you not only need the technology, but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere. 
 And, finally, this storage problem. 
 And, to dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses, and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy. 
 And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here, something that's going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now. 
 It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing. 
 Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using. 
 If you're counting on it for 100 percent, you need an incredible miracle battery. 
 Now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach? 
 Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there? 
 Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds. 
 In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people. 
 And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy." That's good. 
 And, I think, here in the TED group, we have many people who are already pursuing this. 
 Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. 
 Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities, and I'm trying to help back that. 
 Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach. 
 There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid. 
 And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago, so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. 
 The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent, which is the U235 -- we decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238." 
 It is kind of a crazy idea. 
 In fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not, and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that, yes, with the right material's approach, this looks like it would work. 
 And, because you're burning that 99 percent, you have greatly improved cost profile. 
 You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors. 
 So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing. 
 It breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle. 
 You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. 
 In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem. 
 I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. 
 This is the leftover, the 99 percent, where they've taken out the part they burn now, so it's called depleted uranium. 
 That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years. 
 And, simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process, you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet. 
 So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead, but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. 
 So let's think: How should we measure ourselves? 
 What should our report card look like? 
 Well, let's go out to where we really need to get, and then look at the intermediate. 
 For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction. 
 That really is very important, that we get there. 
 And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries, still some agriculture, hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement. 
 So, to get to that 80 percent, the developed countries, including countries like China, will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. 
 So, the other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology, have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere? 
 That's super important. 
 That's a key element of making that report card. 
 So, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like? 
 Well, again, it should have the two elements. 
 We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions: The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2, and, therefore, the less the temperature. 
 But in some ways, the grade we get there, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions, is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other, which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs. 
 These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed, and we can measure that in terms of companies, pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed. 
 There's a lot of great books that have been written about this. 
 The Al Gore book, "Our Choice" and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air." 
 They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly, because we need broad backing for this. 
 There's a lot that has to come together. 
 So this is a wish. 
 It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. 
 If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who's president, I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love, or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick. 
 This is the one with the greatest impact. 
 If we don't get this wish, the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible, between the U.S. and China, between poor countries and rich, and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse. 
 So, what do we have to do? 
 What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive? 
 We need to go for more research funding. 
 When countries get together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just discuss the CO2. 
 They should discuss this innovation agenda, and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. 
 We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there. 
 We need to get the message out. 
 We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue, including the steps that the government takes. 
 This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower, right -- I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is? 
 Bil Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer, hire all the great scientists, which we've done, that's only tens of millions, and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly, then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions. 
 The tough thing is building the pilot reactor; finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location that will actually build the first one of these. 
 Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised, then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density, are so different than nuclear as we know it. 
 And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel, of this sort of spent uranium, and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down? 
 BG: That's right. Today, you're always refueling the reactor, so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong: that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out, that's not good. 
 So, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities. 
 And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done. 
 It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. 
 BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the waste, you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that, and put it into another one and burn that. 
 And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today, that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors -- that's our fuel to begin with. 
 So, the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours, and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process. 
 I mean, you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here. 
 Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this? 
 BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place, and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called "nuclear," so we've got a lot of interest, that people from the company have been in Russia, India, China -- I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here, talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. 
 So I'm optimistic. You know, the French and Japanese have done some work. 
 This is a variant on something that has been done. 
 It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor, and a lot of countries have built them, so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. 
 So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live? 
 BG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things that's very cheap, we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy. 
 That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. 
 And, you know, TerraPower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that. 
 And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who, likewise, if their science goes well, if the funding for their pilot plants goes well, that they can compete for this. 
 And it's best if multiple succeed, because then you could use a mix of these things. 
 We certainly need one to succeed. 
 In terms of big-scale possible game changes, is this the biggest that you're aware of out there? 
 BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. 
 It would have been, even without the environmental constraint, but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. 
 In the nuclear space, there are other innovators. 
 You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one, but the modular people, that's a different approach. 
 There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard, but maybe they say that about us. 
 And so, there are different ones, but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal, and so -- if you can deal with the negatives, which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost, the potential, in terms of effect on land and various things, is almost in a class of its own. 
 If this doesn't work, then what? 
 Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable? 
 BG: If you get into that situation, it's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart attack: Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something. 
 There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering, which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together. 
 Now, that's just an insurance policy. 
 You hope you don't need to do that. 
 Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy, that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. 
 I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem, but there's now the geoengineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster, or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect? 
 Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them, how might you persuade them that they're wrong? 
 BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps. 
 The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. 
 Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things? 
 There are very, very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things. 
 The main problem we have here, it's kind of like AIDS. 
 You make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later. 
 And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems, the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later, and a somewhat uncertain pain thing -- in fact, the IPCC report, that's not necessarily the worst case, and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say, "OK, that isn't that big of a deal." 
 The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. 
 But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic, and meet the CO2 constraints, then the skeptics say, "OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2, I kind of wish it did put out CO2, but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before." 
 And so, that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument, that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem, it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth, it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do. 
 BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&D piece -- say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it's not that dramatic. 
 It shouldn't take away from other things. 
 The thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagree, is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that -- that, to me, mostly is a waste. 
 Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap, I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive. 
 If the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive," then the rich can afford that. 
 I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. 
 The disaster is for that two billion. 
 And even Lomborg has changed. 
 His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&D getting more discussed?" 
 He's still, because of his earlier stuff, still associated with the skeptic camp, but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp, and so, he's making the R&D point. 
 And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. 
 The R&D piece, it's crazy how little it's funded. 
 Well Bill, I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much. 
 BG: Thank you. 
 Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge. 
 And the idea's pretty simple: Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, one yard of string and a marshmallow. 
 The marshmallow has to be on top. 
 And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly. 
 And so, I thought this was an interesting idea, and I incorporated it into a design workshop. 
 And it was a huge success. 
 And since then, I've conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects, even the CTOs of the Fortune 50, and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of them with you. 
 So, normally, most people begin by orienting themselves to the task. 
 They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they jockey for power. 
 Then they spend some time planning, organizing, they sketch and they lay out spaghetti. 
 They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures. 
 And then finally, just as they're running out of time, someone takes out the marshmallow, and then they gingerly put it on top, and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! -- they admire their work. 
 But what really happens, most of the time, is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh," because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse. 
 So there are a number of people who have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others, and among the worst are recent graduates of business school. 
 They lie, they cheat, they get distracted and they produce really lame structures. 
 And of course there are teams that have a lot more "ta-da" structures, and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten. 
 And it's pretty amazing. 
 As Peter tells us, not only do they produce the tallest structures, but they're the most interesting structures of them all. 
 So the question you want to ask is: How come? Why? What is it about them? 
 And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right? 
 They don't spend time jockeying for power. 
 But there's another reason as well. 
 And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan, right? 
 And then they execute on it. 
 And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top, they run out of time and what happens? 
 It's a crisis. 
 Sound familiar? Right. 
 What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, successive prototypes, always keeping the marshmallow on top, so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way. 
 Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process. 
 And with each version, kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work. 
 So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential, but let's look at how different teams perform. 
 So the average for most people is around 20 inches; business schools students, about half of that; lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that, kindergarteners, better than most adults. 
 Who does the very best? 
 Architects and engineers, thankfully. 
 Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen. 
 And why is it? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures. 
 So CEOs, a little bit better than average, but here's where it gets interesting. 
 If you put you put an executive admin. on the team, they get significantly better. 
 It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win." 
 You can just tell beforehand. And why is that? 
 Because they have special skills of facilitation. 
 They manage the process, they understand the process. 
 And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance. 
 Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success. 
 If you have 10 teams that typically perform, you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. 
 And I tried something interesting. 
 I thought, let's up the ante, once. 
 So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team. 
 So what do you think happened to these design students? 
 What was the result? 
 Here's what happened: Not one team had a standing structure. 
 If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure, they would have taken home the prize. 
 So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes have a strong impact. 
 We did the exercise again with the same students. 
 What do you think happened then? 
 So now they understand the value of prototyping. 
 So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best. 
 They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time. 
 So there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success. 
 So, you might ask: Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge? 
 And the reason is, I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects. 
 And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions. 
 Because, frankly, every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it? 
 The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common stance to build the right prototype. 
 And so, this is the value of the experience, of this so simple exercise. 
 And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com. 
 It's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows. 
 There's step-by-step instructions on this. 
 There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system. 
 There's world records that are on this as well. 
 And the fundamental lesson, I believe, is that design truly is a contact sport. 
 It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task, and that we apply the very best of our thinking, our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand. 
 And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment. 
 And that can make a big difference. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Let's pretend right here we have a machine. 
 A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine, and it's a time machine. 
 And everyone in this room has to get into it. 
 And you can go backwards, you can go forwards; you cannot stay where you are. 
 And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back. 
 I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or "American Idol." 
 I don't know. 
 I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia, to wishful thinking. 
 And I understand that. 
 I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say. 
 I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous. 
 It's because possibilities on this planet, they don't go back, they go forward. 
 So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward. 
 This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose: health, wealth, mobility, opportunity, declining rates of disease ... 
 There's never been a time like this. 
 My great-grandparents died, all of them, by the time they were 60. 
 My grandparents pushed that number to 70. 
 My parents are closing in on 80. 
 So there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number. 
 But it's not even about people like us, because this is a bigger deal than that. 
 A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago. 
 Think about that, it's an incredible fact. 
 And why is it true? 
 Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions of people on this planet. 
 It reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has. 
 It's gone. It's vanished. 
 We vanquished it. Puff. 
 In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist, hardly. 
 Diphtheria, rubella, polio ... 
 does anyone even know what those things are? 
 Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, those are triumphs of the scientific method. 
 And to my mind, the scientific method -- trying stuff out, seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't -- is one of the great accomplishments of humanity. 
 So that's the good news. 
 Unfortunately, that's all the good news because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times. 
 And one of them is that despite all our accomplishments, a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day. 
 That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful. 
 And not only that, we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe. 
 Potable water, arable land, rainforests, oil, gas: they're going away, and they're going away soon, and unless we innovate our way out of this mess, we're going away too. 
 So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can. 
 I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on. 
 I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it. 
 I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking. 
 But here's the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night: We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never. 
 And we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today. 
 We're on the verge of amazing, amazing events in many fields, and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment, to find a time when we battled progress, when we fought about these things more vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now. 
 People wrap themselves in their beliefs, and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free. 
 Not even the truth will set them free. 
 And, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion; they're even entitled to their opinion about progress. 
 But you know what you're not entitled to? 
 You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not. 
 And this took me awhile to figure out. 
 About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker. A little story. 
 And I was amazed to find opposition: opposition to what is, after all, the most effective public health measure in human history. 
 I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on. 
 And soon after that, I wrote a story about genetically engineered food. 
 Same thing, only bigger. 
 People were going crazy. 
 So I wrote a story about that too, and I couldn't understand why people thought this was "Frankenfoods," why they thought moving molecules around in a specific, rather than a haphazard way, was trespassing on nature's ground. 
 But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on. 
 I mean, I'm a journalist. 
 We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine. 
 But these stories bothered me, and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did. 
 And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all. 
 They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people. 
 They were exactly like the people in this room. 
 And it just disturbed me so much. 
 But then I thought, you know, let's be honest. 
 We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to. 
 We talk about it ambivalently. 
 We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it: "progress." 
 Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are. 
 We've lost faith in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science itself, and there's no reason we shouldn't have. 
 You can just say a few names and people will understand. 
 Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction, You know, you can choose your list. 
 There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right, so be skeptical. 
 Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence. 
 Don't take anything for granted. 
 But here's the thing: When you get proof, you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that. 
 And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one I've never seen and hope never to see again. 
 About 12 years ago, there was a story published, a horrible story, that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot. 
 Very scary. 
 Tons of studies were done to see if this was true. 
 Tons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue. 
 The data came back. 
 The data came back from the United States, from England, from Sweden, from Canada, and it was all the same: no correlation, no connection, none at all. 
 It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes, we believe what we see, what we think we see, what makes us feel real. 
 We don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data, and I do understand that, I think we all do. 
 But you know what? 
 The result of that has been disastrous. 
 Disastrous because here's a fact: The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down. 
 That is disgraceful, and we should be ashamed of ourselves. 
 It's horrible. 
 What kind of a thing happened that we could do that? 
 Now, I understand it. I do understand it. 
 Because, did anyone have measles here? 
 Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles? 
 Doesn't happen very much. 
 Doesn't happen in this country at all, but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year. 
 That's a lot of death of measles -- 20 an hour. 
 But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like "Oprah" and "Larry King Live." 
 And they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation. 
 They don't understand that these things seem the same, but they're almost never the same. 
 And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon. 
 This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk. 
 He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us. 
 No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone. 
 That guy in the middle, not so much. 
 His name is Paul Offit. 
 He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people. 
 It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids in the developing world every year. 
 Pretty good, right? 
 Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining. 
 And he actually says it that way. 
 So, Paul's a terrorist. 
 When Paul speaks in a public hearing, he can't testify without armed guards. 
 He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school. 
 And why? Because Paul made a vaccine. 
 I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential. 
 You take them away, disease comes back, horrible diseases. And that's happening. 
 We have measles in this country now. 
 And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game. 
 And they're not just going to die of measles. 
 What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? 
 A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident. 
 No one's ever said that before. 
 She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio, no way. 
 Fine. 
 Why? Because we don't have polio. And you know what? 
 We didn't have polio in this country yesterday. 
 Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning, and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio. 
 And he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car, and he's going to come to Long Beach, and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight. 
 And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease, and we don't either because that's the way the world works. 
 That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't. 
 Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it. 
 Everyone take their vitamins this morning? 
 Echinacea, a little antioxidant to get you going. 
 I know you did because half of Americans do every day. 
 They take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines, and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless. 
 The data says it all the time. 
 They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that. 
 It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine? 
 I'm totally with you. 
 Dark urine. Dark. 
 Why do we do that? Why do we do that? 
 Well, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma. 
 We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man. 
 And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks. 
 It's cruel to millions of people. 
 It's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it. 
 So we run away from it, and where do we run? 
 We leap into the arms of Big Placebo. 
 That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo. 
 But, you know, it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap, and we spend billions of dollars on it. 
 And I have all sorts of little props here. 
 None of it ... ginkgo, fraud; echinacea, fraud; acai -- I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it -- it's fraud. 
 And you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me, and they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do. 
 It makes them feel good." 
 And you know what? You're wrong. 
 Because I don't care if it's the secretary of HHS who's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms," or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas. 
 When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science, you end up in a place you don't want to be. 
 You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa. 
 He killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot, garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS. 
 Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease. 
 Please, don't tell me there are no consequences to these things. 
 There are. There always are. 
 Now, the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite. 
 It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop. 
 It's a debate about words, about metaphors. 
 It's ideology, it's not science. 
 Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice, every sprig of parsley, every Brussels sprout has been modified by man. 
 You know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden. 
 There wasn't any cantaloupe. 
 There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all. 
 We made it over the last 11,000 years. 
 And some of it worked, and some of it didn't. 
 We got rid of the stuff that didn't. 
 Now we can do it in a more precise way -- and there are risks, absolutely -- but we can put something like vitamin A into rice, and that stuff can help millions of people, millions of people, prolong their lives. 
 You don't want to do that? 
 I have to say, I don't understand it. 
 We object to genetically engineered food. 
 Why do we do that? 
 Well, the things I constantly hear are: Too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, monoculture, we don't want giant fields of the same thing, that's wrong. 
 We don't companies patenting life. 
 We don't want companies owning seeds. 
 And you know what my response to all of that is? 
 Yes, you're right. Let's fix it. 
 It's true, we've got a huge food problem, but this isn't science. 
 This has nothing to do with science. 
 It's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff. 
 You know science isn't a company. 
 It's not a country. 
 It's not even an idea; it's a process. 
 It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid, is really very deadening, and it's preventing millions of people from prospering. 
 You know, in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now, 70 percent. 
 This investment in Africa over the last 30 years. 
 Disgraceful. Disgraceful. 
 They need it, and we're not giving it to them. 
 And why? Genetically engineered food. 
 We don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance. 
 Cassava's something that half a billion people eat. 
 It's kind of like a potato. 
 It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks. 
 It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein, and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now. 
 And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind. 
 They wouldn't starve, and you know what? 
 That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse, but it would be nice. 
 And all I can say about this is: Why are we fighting it? 
 I mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it? 
 Because we don't want to move genes around? 
 This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals. 
 It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones, our insistence on having bigger food, better food, singular food. 
 This isn't about Rice Krispies, this is about keeping people alive, and it's about time we started to understand what that meant. 
 Because, you know something? 
 If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting, we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of: high-tech colonialism. 
 There's no other way to describe what's going on here. 
 It's selfish, it's ugly, it's beneath us, and we really have to stop it. 
 So after this amazingly fun conversation, you might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward?" 
 Absolutely. Absolutely, I do. 
 It's stuck in the present right now, but we have an amazing opportunity. 
 We can set that time machine on anything we want. 
 We can move it where we want to move it, and we're going to move it where we want to move it. 
 We have to have these conversations and we have to think, but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead, we're going to be happy we do. 
 I know that we can, and as far as I'm concerned, that's something the world needs right now. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect, which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in, unless you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real." 
 In other words, sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies, the placebo effect, just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management, for example, if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect. 
 Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it. 
 In order for us to understand each other, I want to start by showing you a rudimentary, very simple magic trick. 
 And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s. 
 I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s. 
 I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it. 
 And then I'll explain why I explained it. 
 So, here's what happens. 
 The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine. 
 I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this. 
 I'll get my sleeve back. 
 And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here. 
 That way you can see that at no time can anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve. 
 And the object of this is quite simple. 
 I'm going to open my hand, and hopefully, if all is well, my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife. 
 In fact it's held so tightly in place that I can shake it, and the knife does not come off. 
 Nothing goes up or down my sleeve, no trickery. And you can examine everything. 
 Ta-da! 
 So, this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic, because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically. 
 Probably many of you in the room know this trick. 
 What happens is this. 
 I hold the knife in my hand. 
 I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve, that is a lie. 
 The reason I'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion. 
 In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you, this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift from where it is, to a position pointing out like this. 
 Nice one. 
 Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there. 
 So, it goes like this, from here, right. 
 And as I move around my finger shifts. 
 And we could talk about why this is deceptive, why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here, because the mind, and the way it processes information, it doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them. 
 But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up. 
 Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism, but by chicanery, my index finger being there. 
 And then when I close my finger, same thing, as I move back, this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger. 
 I take this hand away. You give the knife out. 
 There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks. 
 Now, what does that have to do with the placebo effect? 
 I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open. 
 I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing. 
 It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill, that's like aspirin shaped -- it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect. 
 But if you change the form that you give the placebo in, like you make a smaller pill, and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it, it is actually measurably more effective. 
 Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills. 
 But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill. 
 What? That really flipped me out. 
 Turns out though, that that's not even where it stops. 
 If you have capsules, they're more effective than tablets in any form. 
 A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule. 
 Dosage has something to do with this. 
 One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills -- I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry. 
 But the point is ... 
 ... these dosages have something to do with it. 
 And the form has something to do with it. 
 And if you want the ultimate in placebo, you've go to the needle. 
 Right? A syringe with some inert -- a couple CCs of some inert something, and you inject this into a patient ... 
 Well this is such a powerful image in their mind, it's so much stronger than the white pill. 
 It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you some other time when we have slides. 
 The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle. 
 And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality, it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect. 
 I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick. 
 And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real. 
 And we know from that study that when you want reality, you go to the needle. 
 This is a seven-inch hatpin. It's very, very sharp, and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit. 
 This is really my flesh. This is not Damian's special-grown flesh. 
 That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect. 
 I'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side. 
 If you're queasy -- if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know, and one woman almost passed out. 
 So, I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it. 
 You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to. 
 So, here is what happens, right here, the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce. 
 I'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out? 
 OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit, and then out the other side like this. 
 Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick. 
 Sort of. 
 But you can't count my fingers right now can you? 
 So, let me show them to you. That's one, two three, four, five. 
 Yes, well... 
 I know what people think when they see this. 
 They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes. 
 So, let me give you a little peek. 
 How's that look out there? Pretty good. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 And the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that." 
 People in the satellite room are starting to move in now. 
 Let me give you good close look at this. 
 That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect. 
 That's my flesh, and I can twist that around. 
 I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away, don't look at the thing. 
 People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be -- see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding. 
 Well let me work up some blood for you. 
 Yes, there it is. 
 Normally now, I would take the needle out. 
 I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds. 
 But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real, I'm just going to leave it there, and walk off the stage. 
 I will be seeing you several times over the next few days. 
 I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much. 
 Everybody talks about happiness these days. 
 I had somebody count the number of books with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more. 
 There is a huge wave of interest in happiness, among researchers. 
 There is a lot of happiness coaching. 
 Everybody would like to make people happier. 
 But in spite of all this flood of work, there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness. 
 And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. 
 This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness, and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness, because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is. 
 The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. 
 It turns out that the word "happiness" is just not a useful word anymore, because we apply it to too many different things. 
 I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it, but by and large, this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is. 
 The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory; basically, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life. 
 And those are two very different concepts, and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness. 
 And the third is the focusing illusion, and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance. 
 I mean, this is a real cognitive trap. 
 There's just no way of getting it right. 
 Now, I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story, and that was a story -- He said he'd been listening to a symphony, and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording, there was a dreadful screeching sound. 
 And then he added, really quite emotionally, it ruined the whole experience. 
 But it hadn't. 
 What it had ruined were the memories of the experience. 
 He had had the experience. 
 He had had 20 minutes of glorious music. 
 They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory; the memory was ruined, and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. 
 What this is telling us, really, is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. 
 There is an experiencing self, who lives in the present and knows the present, is capable of re-living the past, but basically it has only the present. 
 It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know, when the doctor asks, "Does it hurt now when I touch you here?" 
 And then there is a remembering self, and the remembering self is the one that keeps score, and maintains the story of our life, and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question, "How have you been feeling lately?" 
 or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that. 
 Those are two very different entities, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. 
 Now, the remembering self is a storyteller. 
 And that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately. 
 We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. 
 Our memory tells us stories, that is, what we get to keep from our experiences is a story. 
 And let me begin with one example. 
 This is an old study. 
 Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. 
 I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days, but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s. 
 They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds. 
 Here are two patients, those are their recordings. 
 And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?" 
 And it's a very easy question. 
 Clearly, Patient B suffered more -- his colonoscopy was longer, and every minute of pain that Patient A had, Patient B had, and more. 
 But now there is another question: "How much did these patients think they suffered?" 
 And here is a surprise. 
 The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. 
 The stories of the colonoscopies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. 
 And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distinct ... 
 but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. 
 And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end; it's a bad story. 
 How do we know that? 
 Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and much later, too, "How bad was the whole thing, in total?" 
 And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory. 
 Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. 
 From the point of view of the experiencing self, clearly, B had a worse time. 
 Now, what you could do with Patient A, and we actually ran clinical experiments, and it has been done, and it does work -- you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much. 
 That will cause the patient to suffer, but just a little and much less than before. 
 And if you do that for a couple of minutes, you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off, and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off, because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience. 
 What defines a story? 
 And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us, and it's also true of the stories that we make up. 
 What defines a story are changes, significant moments and endings. 
 Endings are very, very important and, in this case, the ending dominated. 
 Now, the experiencing self lives its life continuously. 
 It has moments of experience, one after the other. 
 And you can ask: What happens to these moments? 
 And the answer is really straightforward: They are lost forever. 
 I mean, most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated, you know, the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long; that means that, you know, in a life there are about 600 million of them; in a month, there are about 600,000 -- most of them don't leave a trace. 
 Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. 
 And yet, somehow you get the sense that they should count, that what happens during these moments of experience is our life. 
 It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth. 
 And how to spend it would seem to be relevant, but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us. 
 So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self, and they're really quite distinct. 
 The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. 
 From the point of view of the experiencing self, if you have a vacation, and the second week is just as good as the first, then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation. 
 That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self. 
 For the remembering self, a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added. 
 You have not changed the story. 
 And in this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self; time has very little impact on the story. 
 Now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. 
 It is actually the one that makes decisions because, if you have a patient who has had, say, two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose, then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad, and that's the surgeon that will be chosen. 
 The experiencing self has no voice in this choice. 
 We actually don't choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences. 
 And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally as experiences. 
 We think of our future as anticipated memories. 
 And basically you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self, and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need. 
 I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case; that is, we go on vacations, to a very large extent, in the service of our remembering self. 
 And this is a bit hard to justify I think. 
 I mean, how much do we consume our memories? 
 That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self. 
 And when I think about that, I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had, and I think of it relatively often, relative to how much I think of other vacations. 
 And I probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip, I would say, for about 25 minutes in the last four years. 
 Now, if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it, I would have spent another hour. 
 Now, that is three weeks, and that is at most an hour and a half. 
 There seems to be a discrepancy. 
 Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know, in how little appetite I have for consuming memories, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question: Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences? 
 So I want you to think about a thought experiment. 
 Imagine that for your next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed, and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything. 
 Now, would you choose the same vacation? 
 And if you would choose a different vacation, there is a conflict between your two selves, and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict, and it's actually not at all obvious, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answer, and if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer. 
 Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves. 
 Now, the two selves bring up two notions of happiness. 
 There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one per self. 
 So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self? 
 And then you would ask: How happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life? 
 And they're all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process. 
 What are the emotions that can be measured? 
 And, by the way, now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. 
 If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self, it's a completely different thing. 
 This is not about how happily a person lives. 
 It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life. 
 Very different notion. 
 Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness, and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being, who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way. 
 The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years, and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. 
 The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences, and there have been other efforts along those lines. 
 So in recent years, we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves. 
 And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different. 
 You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life, and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life, and vice versa. 
 Just to give you a sense of the correlation, the correlation is about .5. 
 What that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall," how much would you know about his height? 
 Well, you would know something about his height, but there's a lot of uncertainty. 
 You have that much uncertainty. 
 If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten, you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. 
 So the correlation is low. 
 We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self. 
 We know that money is very important, goals are very important. 
 We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like, spending time with people that we like. 
 There are other pleasures, but this is dominant. 
 So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things. 
 The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being. 
 It is a completely different notion. 
 Now, very quickly, another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life, and we actually live. 
 So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California, you are not going to get to the correct answer. 
 When you ask that question, you think people must be happier in California if, say, you live in Ohio. 
 And what happens is when you think about living in California, you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places, and that contrast, say, is in climate. 
 Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are. 
 But now, because the reflective self is in charge, you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California. 
 And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier. 
 Well, their experiencing self is not going to get happier. 
 We know that. 
 But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier, because, when they think about it, they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio, and they will feel they made the right decision. 
 It is very difficult to think straight about well-being, and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. I've got a question for you. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago, you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey. 
 Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now? 
 Daniel Kahneman: Sure. 
 I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find. 
 We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. 
 When we looked at how feelings, vary with income. 
 And it turns out that, below an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans -- and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000, so it's a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year... 
 60,000. 
 DK: 60,000. 
 60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. 
 Above that, we get an absolutely flat line. 
 I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat. 
 Clearly, what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery, and we can measure that misery very, very clearly. 
 In terms of the other self, the remembering self, you get a different story. 
 The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are. 
 That does not hold for emotions. 
 But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. 
 If people took seriously that finding, I mean, it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about, like for example, taxation policy and so forth. 
 Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally, would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it? 
 DK: You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. 
 The recognition is going to be slow in the United States, no question about that, but in the U.K., it is happening, and in other countries it is happening. 
 People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy. 
 It's going to take a while, and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness, or whether they want to study life evaluation, so we need to have that debate fairly soon. 
 How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think, and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self. 
 This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come. 
 In the United States, efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population. 
 This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two, part of national statistics. 
 Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years. 
 Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics. 
 Thank you, Danny Kahneman. 
 I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer. 
 I've been making games online now for 10 years, and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games. 
 Now, I have a plan for this, and it entails convincing more people, including all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better games. 
 Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games. 
 Some of you might be thinking, "That's a lot of time to spend playing games. 
 Maybe too much time, considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world." 
 But actually, according to my research at The Institute For The Future, it's actually the opposite is true. 
 Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems. 
 In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase that total dramatically. 
 I've calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week. 
 So, that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea, so I'll say it again, let it sink in: If we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity, I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week, by the end of the next decade. 
 No. I'm serious. I am. 
 Here's why. This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species. Truly. 
 This is a portrait by a photographer named Phil Toledano. 
 He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming, so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing. 
 And this is a classic gaming emotion. 
 Now, if you're not a gamer, you might miss some of the nuance in this photo. 
 You probably see the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear, but intense concentration, deep, deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem. 
 If you are a gamer, you will notice a few nuances here: the crinkle of the eyes up, and around the mouth is a sign of optimism, and the eyebrows up is surprise. 
 This is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic win. 
 Oh, you've heard of that. OK, good, so we have some gamers among us. 
 An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it. 
 It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination. 
 And when you get there you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of. That is an epic win. 
 This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win. 
 And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem-solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century -- the face of someone who, against all odds is on the verge of an epic win. 
 Now, unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems. 
 This is what I call the "I'm Not Good At Life" face, and this is actually me making it. Can you see? Yes. Good. 
 This is actually me making the "I'm Not Good At Life" face. 
 This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life. 
 And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have. 
 We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games. 
 And I don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it. 
 We do achieve more in game worlds. But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters, inspired to collaborate and to cooperate. 
 And when we're in game worlds I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves, the most likely to help at a moment's notice, the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes, to get up after failure and try again. 
 And in real life, when we face failure, when we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way. 
 We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed, we feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical. 
 We never have those feelings when we're playing games, they just don't exist in games. 
 So, that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student. 
 What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything? 
 How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work? 
 So, I looked at games like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment. 
 And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds. 
 So, the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away. 
 But not just any mission, it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game. Right? 
 So, you can do it. 
 They never give you a challenge that you can't achieve. 
 But it is on the verge of what you're capable of. So, you have to try hard, but there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft. 
 There is no sitting around wringing your hands, there's always something specific and important to be done. 
 And there are also tons of collaborators. 
 Everywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission. 
 That's not something that we have in real life that easily, this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators. 
 And also there is this epic story, this inspiring story of why we're there, and what we're doing. 
 And then we get all this positive feedback. 
 You guys have heard of leveling up and plus-one strength, and plus-one intelligence. 
 We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life. 
 When I get off this stage I'm not going to have plus-one speaking, and plus-one crazy idea, plus-20 crazy idea. 
 I don't get that feedback in real life. 
 Now, the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds. 
 It's just better than reality. 
 So, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth. 
 Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. 
 It might sound like it's a bad thing. 
 But to put that in context: 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up. 
 That was the first upright primate. 
 Okay, so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games, the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing. 
 But it's also apt. Because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games, we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings. 
 We are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species. 
 This is true. I believe this. 
 So, consider this really interesting statistic; it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University: The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21. 
 Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons. 
 First of all, for children in the United States 10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance. 
 So, we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they are learning about everything else in school. 
 And some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book "Outliers." 
 So, you would have heard of his theory of success, the 10,000 hour theory of success. 
 It's based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of effortful study at anything by the age of 21, we will be virtuosos at it. 
 We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world. 
 And so, now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers. 
 So, the big question is, "What exactly are gamers getting so good at?" 
 Because if we could figure that out, we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands. 
 This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games. 
 These are our virtuoso gamers, 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something. 
 And in the next decade we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is. 
 If you don't know it already, this is coming. 
 The game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet so that gamers all over the world, particularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online. 
 They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. 
 It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers. 
 So, I've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at. 
 Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism. 
 OK, think of this as extreme self-motivation. 
 Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle, combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. 
 Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible, and that it is always worth trying, and trying now. 
 Gamers don't sit around. 
 Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric. 
 There's a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them, even if they've beaten us badly. 
 And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone. 
 We trust that they will spend their time with us, that they will play by the same rules, value the same goal, they'll stay with the game until it's over. 
 And so, playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation. 
 And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. 
 Blissful productivity. I love it. 
 You know there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week, kind of a half-time job. 
 It's because we know, when we're playing a game, that we're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing, or hanging out. 
 We know that we are optimized, as human beings, to do hard meaningful work. 
 And gamers are willing to work hard all the time, if they're given the right work. 
 Finally: epic meaning. 
 Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories. 
 So, just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective: So, you all know Wikipedia, biggest wiki in the world. 
 Second biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles, is the World of Warcraft wiki. 
 Five million people use it every month. 
 They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world. 
 They are building an epic story. 
 They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft. 
 Okay, so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing: Gamers are super-empowered, hopeful individuals. 
 These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world. 
 And the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world. 
 That's the problem that I'm trying to solve. 
 There's an economist named Edward Castronova. 
 His work is brilliant. He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds. 
 And he says, "We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments." 
 And he's an economist. So, he's rational. 
 And he says ... 
 Not like me -- I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant. 
 But he says that this makes perfect sense, because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life. 
 They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life; they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life. 
 So, he says for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world. 
 Now, I also agree that that is rational, for now. 
 But it is not, by any means, an optimal situation. 
 We have to start making the real world more like a game. 
 So, I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago. 
 These are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles. Right? 
 Before we had awesome game controllers, we had sheep's knuckles. 
 And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings. 
 And if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, you might know this history, which is the history of who invented games and why. 
 Herodotus says that games, particularly dice games, were invented in the kingdom of Lydia during a time of famine. 
 Apparently, there was such a severe famine that the king of Lydia decided that they had to do something crazy. 
 People were suffering. People were fighting. 
 It was an extreme situation, they needed an extreme solution. 
 So, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom-wide policy: On one day, everybody would eat, and on the next day, everybody would play games. 
 And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging, and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity, they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat. 
 And then on the next day, they would play games; and on the next day, they would eat. 
 And according to Herodotus, they passed 18 years this way, surviving through a famine by eating on one day and playing games on the next. 
 Now, this is exactly, I think, how we're using games today. 
 We're using games to escape real-world suffering. 
 We're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment, everything that's not satisfying about real life, and we're getting what we need from games. 
 But it doesn't have to end there. 
 This is really exciting. 
 According to Herodotus, after 18 years the famine wasn't getting better, so the king decided they would play one final dice game. 
 They divided the entire kingdom in half. 
 They played one dice game, and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure. 
 They would leave Lydia, and they would go out in search of a new place to live, leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available, and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive. 
 Now, this sounds crazy, right? 
 But recently, DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans, who then led to the Roman Empire, actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians. 
 And so, recently, scientists have suggested that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true. 
 And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine. 
 So, this crazy story might be true. 
 They might have actually saved their culture by playing games, escaping to games for 18 years, and then been so inspired, and knew so much about how to come together with games, that they actually saved the entire civilization that way. 
 Okay, we can do that. 
 We've been playing Warcraft since 1994. 
 That was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series. That was 16 years ago. 
 They played dice games for 18 years, we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years. 
 I say we are ready for our own epic game. 
 Now, they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world, so that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from. 
 Let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games, until we solve real-world problems. 
 Now, I know you're asking, "How are we going to solve real world problems in games?" Well, that's what I have devoted my work to over the past few years, at The Institute For The Future. 
 We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto, and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future. 
 We do not want to try to predict the future. 
 What we want to do is make the future. 
 We want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome, and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality. 
 We want to imagine epic wins, and then give people the means to achieve the epic win. 
 I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures. 
 So, this is World Without Oil. 
 We made this game in 2007. 
 This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage. 
 The oil shortage is fictional, but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real, and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil. So when you come to the game, you sign up, you tell us where you live, and then we give you real-time news, videos, data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs, what's not available, how food supply is being affected, how transportation is being affected, if schools are closed, if there is rioting, and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it, to post videos, to post photos. 
 We piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we've tracked them for the three years since. 
 And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience. 
 Nobody wants to change how they live just because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to. 
 But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them, "We've run out of oil. 
 This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on. 
 Challenge yourself to see how you would survive," most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game. 
 So, for the next world-saving game, we decided to aim higher: bigger problem than just peak oil. 
 We did a game called Superstruct at The Institute For The Future. 
 And the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet. 
 This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System, of course. 
 We asked people to come online almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. 
 You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team -- you've got the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-convict, and they all have something to do to save the world. 
 But in our game, instead of just having five people on the dream team, we said, "Everybody's on the dream team, and it's your job to invent the future of energy, the future of food, the future of health, the future of security and the future of the social safety net." 
 We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks. 
 They came up with 500 insanely creative solutions that you can go online, if you Google "Superstruct," and see. 
 So, finally, the last game, we're launching it March 3rd. This is a game done with the World Bank Institute. 
 If you complete the game you will be certified by the World Bank Institute, as a Social Innovator, class of 2010. 
 Working with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa, and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills. 
 We've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up in skills like local insight, knowledge networking, sustainability, vision and resourcefulness. 
 I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people, anywhere in the world, particularly in developing areas, who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world. 
 So, I'm going to wrap up now. 
 I want to ask a question. 
 What do you think happens next? 
 We've got all these amazing gamers, we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do, but none of them have saved the real world yet. 
 Well I hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real-world work, that games are a powerful platform for change. 
 We have all these amazing superpowers: blissful productivity, the ability to weave a tight social fabric, this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning. 
 I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter, to survive on this planet for another century. 
 And that's my hope, that you will join me in making and playing games like this. 
 When I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for sure: that we can make any future we can imagine, and we can play any games we want. 
 So, I say: Let the world-changing games begin. 
 Thank you. 
 I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired. 
 I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything, but I'd already finished editing the piece, and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find. 
 Let me read you the entry. 
 "Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked, stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated, run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped, senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in cracked-up, counted-out; see also hurt, useless and weak. 
 Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable." 
 I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing, it was so ludicrous, but I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke, and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed. 
 You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right? 
 But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s, when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me. 
 And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then. 
 I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them, when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured. 
 So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition, expecting to find a revision worth noting. 
 Here's the updated version of this entry. 
 Unfortunately, it's not much better. 
 I find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling: "whole" and "wholesome." 
 So, it's not just about the words. 
 It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words. 
 It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values. 
 Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people. 
 In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans, believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful, because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence. 
 So, what reality do we want to call into existence: a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered? 
 By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child, we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power. 
 Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead? 
 One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware. 
 His name was Dr. Pizzutillo, an Italian American, whose name, apparently, was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce, so he went by Dr. P. 
 And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children. 
 I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital, with the exception of my physical therapy sessions. 
 I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick, elastic bands -- different colors, you know -- to help build up my leg muscles, and I hated these bands more than anything -- I hated them, had names for them. I hated them. 
 And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child, with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises, unsuccessfully, of course. 
 And, one day, he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions -- and he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl, I think you're going to break one of those bands. 
 When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks." 
 Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward, but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me. 
 And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future. 
 This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child. 
 But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries, our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want, the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable. 
 Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society, many of which have been brought about by technology. 
 Certainly, from a medical standpoint, my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment, titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities, and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves, so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing. 
 So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth: that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society, and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset. 
 The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing, because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity, and I'm going to make an admission: This phrase never sat right with me, and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it, and I think I'm starting to figure out why. 
 Implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity" is the idea that success, or happiness, is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience, as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics, or what other people perceive as my disability. 
 But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge, whether physically, emotionally or both. 
 And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing. 
 Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life. 
 It's part of our life. 
 And I tend to think of it like my shadow. 
 Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little, but it's always with me. 
 And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle. 
 There is adversity and challenge in life, and it's all very real and relative to every single person, but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity, but how you're going to meet it. 
 So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity, but preparing them to meet it well. 
 And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt. 
 There's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled. 
 And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions. 
 In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis, or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life, we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone. 
 Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself. 
 By not treating the wholeness of a person, by not acknowledging their potency, we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have. 
 We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community. 
 So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability. 
 And, most importantly, there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability. 
 So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug, but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity. 
 So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it, embracing it, grappling with it, to use a wrestling term, maybe even dancing with it. 
 And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful, we're less burdened by the presence of it. 
 This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution, that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character. 
 To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives, nor is it the most intelligent that survives; it is the one that is most adaptable to change. 
 Conflict is the genesis of creation. 
 From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation. 
 So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill. 
 And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of. 
 Maybe that's what adversity gives us: a sense of self, a sense of our own power. 
 So, we can give ourselves a gift. 
 We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times. 
 Maybe we can see it as change. 
 Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet. 
 I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy. 
 Now, who's normal? 
 There's no normal. 
 There's common, there's typical. There's no normal, and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed? 
 I don't think so. 
 If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children, and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community. 
 Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use, to be able to contribute. 
 There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago, carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury, and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community. 
 They didn't view these people as broken and useless; they were seen as rare and valuable. 
 A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania, and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes. 
 It was summertime: I had shorts on. 
 I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins." 
 And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is. 
 And I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you." 
 He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me. 
 I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb." 
 Oh, that guy. 
 And, but of course, actually, it did click. 
 This man was Dr. Kean, a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day, because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks. 
 And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation, so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents. 
 And, because I was born without the fibula bones, and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that, he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news. 
 He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk, and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence, and you've been making liar out of me ever since." 
 The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood, whether winning a second grade spelling bee, marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade, winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories, and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students, med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School. 
 And he called this part of the course the X Factor, the potential of the human will. 
 No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone's life. 
 And Dr. Kean went on to tell me, he said, "In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise, and even if given a modicum of support, if left to their own devices, a child will achieve." 
 See, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking. 
 He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it. 
 And there's been a shift in my thinking over time, in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old, if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs, I wouldn't have hesitated for a second. 
 I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then. 
 But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure. 
 And it's because of the experiences I've had with them, not in spite of the experiences I've had with them. 
 And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me. 
 See, all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off. 
 If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment, you are educating them in the best sense. 
 You're teaching them to open doors for themselves. 
 In fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate" comes from the root word "educe." 
 It means "to bring forth what is within, to bring out potential." 
 So again, which potential do we want to bring out? 
 There was a case study done in 1960s Britain, when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools. 
 It's called the streaming trials. We call it "tracking" here in the States. 
 It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on. 
 And the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc. 
 Well, they took, over a three-month period, D-level students, gave them A's, told them they were "A's," told them they were bright, and at the end of this three-month period, they were performing at A-level. 
 And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study, is that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's." 
 And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period. 
 Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out. 
 A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too. 
 The teachers didn't know a switch had been made. 
 They were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'" And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them. 
 So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit, a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope, it doesn't see beauty, it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine. 
 If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope, to see beauty in themselves and others, to be curious and imaginative, then we are truly using our power well. 
 When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities and new ways of being. 
 I'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about, and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words": "Every child has known God, not the God of names, not the God of don'ts, but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them, saying, 'Come dance with me. 
 Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'" Thank you. 
 Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day? 
 Do you know how many choices you make in typical week? 
 I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans, and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day. 
 There was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week. 
 And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks. 
 And they found that the average CEO engaged in about 139 tasks in a week. 
 Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course. 
 50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less. 
 Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time. 
 Think about your own choices. 
 Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category? 
 How well do you think you're doing at managing those choices? 
 Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have, which is the choice overload problem. 
 I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions. 
 Now as I talk about this problem, I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answers. 
 So when I ask you a question, since I'm blind, only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. 
 Otherwise, when I ask you a question, and if your answer is yes, I'd like you to clap your hands. 
 So for my first question for you today: Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem? 
 Thank you. 
 So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store; at least at that time it was truly upscale. 
 It was a store called Draeger's. 
 Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park. 
 They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water. 
 I used to love going to this store, but on one occasion I asked myself, well how come you never buy anything? 
 Here's their olive oil aisle. 
 They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil, including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand-year-old olive trees. 
 So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager, and I asked the manager, "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?" 
 And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday, with cameras ready usually. 
 We decided to do a little experiment, and we picked jam for our experiment. 
 Here's their jam aisle. 
 They had 348 different kinds of jam. 
 We set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store. 
 We there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam, and we looked at two things: First, in which case were people more likely to stop, sample some jam? 
 More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent, than when there were six, about 40 percent. 
 The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam. 
 Now we see the opposite effect. 
 Of the people who stopped when there were 24, only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. 
 Of the people who stopped when there were six, well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. 
 Now if you do the math, people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24. 
 Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it's good for our waistlines -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions. 
 We choose not to choose, even when it goes against our best self-interests. 
 So now for the topic of today: financial savings. 
 Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans all in the U.S. 
 And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan, the 401 plan, does that affect people's likelihood to save more for tomorrow. 
 And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation. 
 So in these plans, we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings. 
 And what we found was that, the more funds offered, indeed, there was less participation rate. 
 So if you look at the extremes, those plans that offered you two funds, participation rates were around in the mid-70s -- still not as high as we want it to be. 
 In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds, participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile. 
 Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present, even then, it has negative consequences. 
 So for those people who did choose to participate, the more choices available, the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds. 
 The more choices available, the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts. 
 Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well-being. 
 Well, over the past decade, we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices. 
 They're more likely to delay choosing -- procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest. 
 They're more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices, medical choices. 
 They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied, even when they do objectively better. 
 The main reason for this is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams, but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display. 
 So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses. 
 The first: Cut. 
 You've heard it said before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more. 
 People are always upset when I say, "Cut." 
 They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space. 
 But in fact, what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut, get rid of those extraneous redundant options, well there's an increase in sales, there's a lowering of costs, there is an improvement of the choosing experience. 
 When Proctor & Gamble went from 26 different kinds of Head & Shoulders to 15, they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent. 
 When the Golden Cat Corporation got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products, they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs. 
 You know, the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products. 
 The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products. 
 But the ninth largest retailer, the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is Aldi, and it offers you only 1,400 products -- one kind of canned tomato sauce. 
 Now in the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing, which was the program that they have at Harvard. 
 Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund. 
 For those people who actually want to choose, they're given 20 funds, not 300 or more funds. 
 You know, often, people say, "I don't know how to cut. 
 They're all important choices." 
 And the first thing I do is I ask the employees, "Tell me how these choices are different from one another. 
 And if your employees can't tell them apart, neither can your consumers." 
 Now before we started our session this afternoon, I had a chat with Gary. 
 And Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world. 
 Here's a description of the road. 
 And I'd like you to read it. 
 And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer. 
 Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer. 
 Is that all? 
 All right, let me show you some more about this. 
 You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you. 
 Now who's ready to go on this trip. 
 I think I might have actually heard more hands. 
 All right. 
 Now in fact, you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around, but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around. 
 Because the pictures made it feel more real to you. 
 Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem, which is concretization. 
 That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices, they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice, and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way. 
 Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card as opposed to cash? 
 Because it doesn't feel like real money. 
 And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more. 
 So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero, we did a study with people at ING -- employees that are all working at ING -- and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan. 
 And during that session, we kept the session exactly the way it used to be, but we added one little thing. 
 The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more. 
 By doing that simple thing, there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent. 
 The third technique: Categorization. 
 We can handle more categories than we can handle choices. 
 So for example, here's a study we did in a magazine aisle. 
 It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor, the magazine aisles range anywhere from 331 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 664. 
 But you know what? 
 If I show you 600 magazines and I divide them up into 10 categories, versus I show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories, you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600. 
 Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart. 
 Here are two different jewelry displays. 
 One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing." 
 If you think the display on the left is Swing and the display on the right is Jazz, clap your hands. 
 Okay, there's some. 
 If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, clap your hands. 
 Okay, a bit more. 
 Now it turns out you're right. 
 The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, but you know what? 
 This is a highly useless categorization scheme. 
 The categories need to say something to the chooser, not the choice-maker. 
 And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds. 
 Who are they actually supposed to be informing? 
 My fourth technique: Condition for complexity. 
 It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can, we've just got to take it a little easier. 
 We have to gradually increase the complexity. 
 I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about. 
 Let's take a very, very complicated decision: buying a car. 
 Here's a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car. 
 You've got to make 60 different decisions, completely make up your car. 
 Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision. 
 Car colors, exterior car colors -- I've got 56 choices. 
 Engines, gearshift -- four choices. 
 So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear. 
 So half of the customers are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors, to low choice, four gearshifts. 
 The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts, to 56 car colors, high choice. 
 What am I going to look at? 
 How engaged you are. 
 If you keep hitting the default button per decision, that means you're getting overwhelmed, that means I'm losing you. 
 What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice, they're hitting that default button over and over and over again. 
 We're losing them. 
 They go from low choice to high choice, they're hanging in there. 
 It's the same information. It's the same number of choices. 
 The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented. 
 If I start you off easy, I learn how to choose. 
 Even though choosing gearshift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor, it still prepares me for how to choose. 
 It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together, so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged. 
 So let me recap. 
 I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives; concretize -- make it real; categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices; condition for complexity. 
 All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you, you can use them on yourself, better for the people that you are serving. 
 Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing. 
 And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos. 
 It's true. 
 So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters. 
 We all want to be stars -- celebrities, singers, comedians -- and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do. 
 But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture. 
 Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday. 
 But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute. 
 And of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment. 
 So how does it happen? 
 Three things: tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness. 
 All right, let's go. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Wooo! 
 Ohhhhh, wowwww! 
 Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park. 
 In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times. 
 This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer. 
 But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear. 
 He just wanted to share a rainbow. 
 Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear. 
 And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact. 
 And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January. 
 So what happened here? 
 Jimmy Kimmel actually. 
 Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become. 
 Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience. 
 It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope. 
 Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year. 
 It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year. 
 This is a chart of what it looked like. 
 And similar to "Double Rainbow," it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere. 
 So what happened on this day? 
 Well it was a Friday, this is true. 
 And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays. 
 But what about this day, this one particular Friday? 
 Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about. 
 Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter. 
 But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process. 
 And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it. 
 And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube. 
 Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week. 
 Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it. 
 So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation with looped music. 
 It's this, just like this. 
 It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year. 
 And if you think that that is weird, you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that's been viewed four million times. 
 Even cats were watching this video. 
 Cats were watching other cats watch this video. 
 But what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture. 
 There were remixes. 
 Someone made an old timey version. 
 And then it went international. 
 An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of. 
 Because we don't just enjoy now, we participate. 
 And who could have predicted any of this? 
 Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black or "Nyan Cat?" 
 What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it? 
 In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have. 
 When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested. 
 So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane. 
 By being totally surprising and humorous, Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times. 
 And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively. 
 And so it all brings us to one big question ... 
 What does this mean? 
 Ohhhh. 
 What does it mean? 
 Tastemakers, creative participating communities, complete unexpectedness, these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity. 
 I mean, as mentioned earlier, one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber, got his start on YouTube. 
 No one has to green-light your idea. 
 And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture. 
 And these are not characteristics of old media, and they're barely true of the media of today, but they will define the entertainment of the future. 
 Thank you. 
 How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago, bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today? 
 This is not a finished story. 
 It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together. 
 Let me tell you about some of the pieces. 
 Imagine the first piece: a man burning his life's work. 
 He is a poet, a playwright, a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom. 
 Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon, confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste. 
 Words, for so long his friends, now mocked him. 
 He retreated into silence. 
 He died broken by history. 
 He is my grandfather. 
 I never knew him in real life. 
 But our lives are much more than our memories. 
 My grandmother never let me forget his life. 
 My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crush us, but we endured. 
 The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea. 
 My mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage, already with two small girls. 
 For her, life had distilled itself into one task: the escape of her family and a new life in Australia. 
 It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed. 
 So after a four-year saga that defies fiction, a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel. 
 All the adults knew the risks. 
 The greatest fear was of pirates, rape and death. 
 Like most adults on the boat, my mother carried a small bottle of poison. 
 If we were captured, first my sister and I, then she and my grandmother would drink. 
 My first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine, the bow dipping into each wave, the vast and empty horizon. 
 I don't remember the pirates who came many times, but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours. 
 But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died, the journey's end too much for him, and the first apple I tasted, given to me by the men on the rig. 
 No apple has ever tasted the same. 
 After three months in a refugee camp, we landed in Melbourne. 
 And the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together. 
 We settled in Footscray, a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants. 
 Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs, whose existence I was oblivious of, there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray. 
 The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world. 
 And the snippets of halting English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common, they were starting again. 
 My mother worked on farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double shifts. 
 Somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications. 
 We were poor. 
 All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out, which was usually new clothes; they were always secondhand. 
 Two pairs of stockings for school, each to hide the holes in the other. 
 A school uniform down to the ankles, because it had to last for six years. 
 And there were rare but searing chants of "slit-eye" and the occasional graffiti: "Asian, go home." 
 Go home to where? 
 Something stiffened inside me. 
 There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying, "I will bypass you." 
 My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed. 
 My mother was exhausted each night, but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house. 
 My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat. 
 And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her. 
 She opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business. 
 And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition, angry and inflexible, and troubled children caught between two worlds. 
 Grants and sponsors were sought. 
 Centers were established. 
 I lived in parallel worlds. 
 In one, I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself. 
 In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious, tragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation. 
 But so many over the years were helped. 
 And for that work, when I was a final year law student, I was chosen as the young Australian of the year. 
 And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another, and their edges didn't fit. 
 Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident, was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined. 
 I didn't know the protocols. 
 I didn't know how to use the cutlery. 
 I didn't know how to talk about wine. 
 I didn't know how to talk about anything. 
 I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed. 
 I told my mother I couldn't do it. 
 She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat. 
 No had never been an option. 
 "Just do it," she said, "and don't be what you're not." 
 So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised. 
 And the more candidly I spoke, the more I was asked to speak. 
 I met people from all walks of life, so many of them doing the thing they loved, living on the frontiers of possibility. 
 And even though I finished my degree, I realized I could not settle into a career in law. 
 There had to be another piece of the jigsaw. 
 And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider, a recent arrival, new on the scene -- and not just okay, but something to be thankful for, perhaps a gift from the boat. 
 Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons, can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province. 
 I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that, yes, the world does fall apart, but not in the way that you fear. 
 Possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged. 
 There was an energy there, an implacable optimism, a strange mixture of humility and daring. 
 So I followed my hunches. 
 I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label "It can't be done" was an irresistible challenge. 
 For a year we were penniless. 
 At the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared. 
 We worked well into each night. 
 Most of our ideas were crazy, but a few were brilliant, and we broke through. 
 I made the decision to move to the U.S. 
 after only one trip. 
 My hunches again. 
 Three months later I had relocated, and the adventure has continued. 
 Before I close though, let me tell you about my grandmother. 
 She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered. 
 Life hadn't changed for centuries. 
 Her father died soon after she was born. 
 Her mother raised her alone. 
 At 17 she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her. 
 With no support from her husband, she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case, and a far greater sensation when she won. 
 "It can't be done" was shown to be wrong. 
 I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in Melbourne. 
 I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side. 
 I knew she had come to say goodbye. 
 My mother phoned minutes later. 
 A few days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket. 
 We told her stories At midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket. 
 My mother asked us to feel her hand. 
 She asked the monk, "Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?" 
 "Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said. 
 "You have not let it go." 
 If there is a sinew in our family, it runs through the women. 
 Given who we were and how life had shaped us, we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us. 
 Defeat would have come too easily. 
 Now I would like to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat. 
 Who could ever wish it on their own? 
 Yet I am afraid of privilege, of ease, of entitlement. 
 Can I give them a bow in their lives, dipping bravely into each wave, the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine, the vast horizon that guarantees nothing? 
 I don't know. 
 But if I could give it and still see them safely through, I would. 
 And also, Tan's mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row. 
 I'm here to share my photography. 
 Or is it photography? 
 Because, of course, this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera. 
 Yet, my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15. 
 It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing, but it was a bit different, because using the camera, the process was in the planning instead. 
 And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when you press the trigger. 
 So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time. 
 I felt like anyone could do that. 
 So I wanted to create something different, something where the process starts when you press the trigger. 
 Photos like this: construction going on along a busy road. 
 But it has an unexpected twist. 
 And despite that, it retains a level of realism. 
 Or photos like these -- both dark and colorful, but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism. 
 When I say realism, I mean photo-realism. 
 Because, of course, it's not something you can capture really, but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph. 
 Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick. 
 So it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really. 
 But what's the trick that makes it look realistic? 
 Is it something about the details or the colors? 
 Is it something about the light? 
 What creates the illusion? 
 Sometimes the perspective is the illusion. 
 But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface. 
 It's not really what is realistic, it's what we think looks realistic really. 
 So I think the basics are quite simple. 
 I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality. 
 And let me show you a simple example. 
 Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects, something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world. 
 But combined in a certain way, they can create something that still looks three-dimensional, like it could exist. 
 But at the same time, we know it can't. 
 So we trick our brains, because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense. 
 And I see the same process with combining photographs. 
 It's just really about combining different realities. 
 So the things that make a photograph look realistic, I think it's the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives. 
 But when combining photographs, this is really important to consider, because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow. 
 So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result. 
 As you can see, these images aren't really special. 
 But combined, they can create something like this. 
 So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective. 
 Secondly, photos combined should have the same type of light. 
 And these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light. 
 The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless. 
 Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed. 
 So by matching color, contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images, adding photographic defects like depth of field, desaturated colors and noise, we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image, despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically. 
 So here's another example. 
 One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated. 
 But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations. 
 I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head. 
 But it does require a lot of planning. 
 And getting this idea during winter, I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically. 
 So for example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip. 
 The shores are from a different location. 
 The underwater part was captured in a stone pit. 
 And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish. 
 So to achieve a realistic result, I think it comes down to planning. 
 It always starts with a sketch, an idea. 
 Then it's about combining the different photographs. 
 And here every piece is very well planned. 
 And if you do a good job capturing the photos, the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic. 
 So all the tools are out there, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination. 
 Thank you. 
 I would like to talk to you about why many e-health projects fail. 
 And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients. 
 And one of the things we did at Radboud University is we appointed a chief listening officer. 
 Not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients, family, relatives, "What's up? 
 How could we help you?" 
 And we think, we like to think, that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-health projects fail, since we stopped listening. 
 This is my WiFi scale. It's a very simple thing. 
 It's got one knob, on/off. 
 And every morning I hop on it. 
 And yes, I've got a challenge, as you might see. 
 And I put my challenge on 95 kg. 
 But the thing is that it's made this simple that whenever I hop on, it sends my data through Google Health as well. 
 And it's collected by my general practitioner as well, so he can see what's my problem in weight, not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support or something like it, but also looking backward. 
 But there's another thing. 
 As some of you might know, I've got more than 4,000 followers on Twitter. 
 So every morning I hop on my WiFi scale and before I'm in my car, people start talking to me, "I think you need a light lunch today, Lucien." 
 But that's the nicest thing that could happen, since this is peer pressure, peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity, it could be used to stop smoking in patients. 
 But on the other hand, it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health. 
 As of next week, it will soon be available. 
 There will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other. 
 And people will be able, from their homes, to take their blood pressure, send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others, for instance, for over a hundred dollars. 
 And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect, not only their own control again, be captain of their own ship, but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face, like health care cost explosion, doubled demand and things like that. 
 Make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team. 
 And you can do this with techniques like this, but also by crowd-sourcing. 
 And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video. 
 We've all got navigation controls in our car. 
 We maybe even [have] it in our cellphone. 
 We know perfectly where all the ATMs are about the city of Maastricht. 
 The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are. 
 And sure, we could find fast food chains. 
 But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient? 
 We asked around and nobody knew. 
 Nobody knew where the nearest life-saving AED was to be obtained right now. 
 So what we did, we crowdsourced The Netherlands. 
 We set up a website and asked the crowd, "If you see an AED, please submit it, tell us where it is, tell us when it's open," since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's closed, of course. 
 And over 10,000 AEDs already in The Netherlands already have been submitted. 
 The next step we took was to find the applications for it. 
 And we built an iPad application. 
 We made an application for Layar, augmented reality, to find these AEDs. 
 And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses, you can use your iPhone, and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone, to find the nearest AED which can save lives. 
 And as of today, we would like to introduce this, not only as AED4EU, which is what the product is called, but also AED4US. 
 And we would like to start this on a worldwide level. 
 And [we're] asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world, colleague universities, to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowd-source all these AEDs all around the world. 
 That whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses, might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you, you can find this. 
 The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these AEDs. 
 These might be courier services or cable guys for instance, just to see whether the AED that's submitted still is in place. 
 So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better, but take control of it. 
 Thank you. 
 Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries. 
 Now I work in the solar technology industry. 
 And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ... 
 ... paying attention to crowd-sourcing. 
 It's just a quick video of what we do. 
 Huh. Hang on a moment. 
 It might take a moment to load. 
 We'll just -- we can just skip -- I'll just skip through the video instead ... 
 No. 
 This is not ... 
 Okay. 
 Solar technology is ... 
 Oh, that's all my time? 
 Okay. Thank you very much. 
 So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate; we have them work in government. 
 The program is called Code for America, and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks. 
 We select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments. 
 Instead of sending them off into the Third World, we send them into the wilds of City Hall. 
 And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers. 
 But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today. 
 So meet Al. 
 Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston. 
 Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date, but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in, because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of snow. 
 Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner? 
 We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program. 
 They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year. 
 And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants. 
 But one fellow in particular, a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober, noticed something else, and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things. 
 So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app. 
 It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant. 
 So you agree to dig it out when it snows. 
 If you do, you get to name it, and he called the first one Al. 
 And if you don't, someone can steal it from you. 
 So it's got cute little game dynamics on it. 
 This is a modest little app. 
 It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year. 
 But it's doing something that no other government technology does. 
 It's spreading virally. 
 There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it, not for snow, but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens. 
 It's very important that these tsunami sirens work, but people steal the batteries out of them. 
 So he's getting citizens to check on them. 
 And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains. 
 And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows. 
 So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this. 
 And this has spread just frictionlessly, organically, naturally. 
 If you know anything about government technology, you know that this isn't how it normally goes. 
 Procuring software usually takes a couple of years. 
 We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months. 
 It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids. 
 We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels, it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars. 
 And that's nothing. 
 There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars, and it doesn't work. 
 And there are projects like this at every level of government. 
 So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government. 
 It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company, as many people think it should. 
 And not even like a tech company, but more like the Internet itself. 
 And that means permissionless, it means open, it means generative. 
 And that's important. 
 But what's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an ossified institution, but as a problem of collective action. 
 And that's great news, because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action with digital technology. 
 Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively. 
 It's not just Code for America fellows, there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities. 
 They haven't given up on government. 
 They are frustrated as hell with it, but they're not complaining about it, they're fixing it. 
 And these folks know something that we've lost sight of. 
 And that's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we're really mad about, government is, at its core, in the words of Tim O'Reilly, "What we do together that we can't do alone." 
 Now a lot of people have given up on government. 
 And if you're one of those people, I would ask that you reconsider, because things are changing. 
 Politics is not changing; government is changing. 
 And because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember "We the people?" -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens. 
 Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program. 
 And like a lot of people, I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office. 
 Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion that, especially local government, is about opossums. 
 This is the call center for the services and information line. 
 It's generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city. 
 If you should ever have the chance to staff your city's call center, as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program -- in fact, they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues, including having an opossum stuck in your house. 
 So Scott gets this call. 
 He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base. 
 He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control. 
 And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves?" 
 So that worked. So booya for Scott. 
 But that wasn't the end of the opossums. 
 Boston doesn't just have a call center. 
 It has an app, a Web and mobile app, called Citizens Connect. 
 Now we didn't write this app. 
 This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston. 
 So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in: "Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead. 
 How do I get this removed?" 
 But what happens with Citizens Connect is different. 
 So Scott was speaking person-to-person. 
 But on Citizens Connect everything is public, so everybody can see this. 
 And in this case, a neighbor saw it. 
 And the next report we got said, "I walked over to this location, found the trashcan behind the house. 
 Opossum? Check. Living? Yep. 
 Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home. 
 Goodnight sweet opossum." 
 Pretty simple. 
 So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical. 
 And it's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game. 
 But it's also a great example of government as a platform. 
 And I don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here. 
 I'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others. 
 So one citizen helped another citizen, but government played a key role here. 
 It connected those two people. 
 And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed, but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services. 
 When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen our communities. 
 We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money. 
 Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics. 
 And most people get that, but they think that one is the input to the other. 
 That our input to the system of government is voting. 
 Now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs, and then not that much changes? 
 That's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top. 
 And what's under that is what we call bureaucracy. 
 And we say that word with such contempt. 
 But it's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that's working against us, this other thing, and then we're disempowering ourselves. 
 People seem to think politics is sexy. 
 If we want this institution to work for us, we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy. 
 Because that's where the real work of government happens. 
 We have to engage with the machinery of government. 
 So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done. 
 Have you seen these guys? 
 It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 325-page report that's a response to the SEC's request for comment on the Financial Reform Bill. 
 That's not being politically active, that's being bureaucratically active. 
 Now for those of us who've given up on government, it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children. 
 You have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face. 
 Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us? 
 We can't do without government, but we do need it to be more effective. 
 The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society. 
 And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet, and they know that it's not that hard to do things together, you just have to architect the systems the right way. 
 Now the average age of our fellows is 28, so I am, begrudgingly, almost a generation older than most of them. 
 This is a generation that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted. 
 They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak; they all get to speak. 
 They can express their opinion on any channel at any time, and they do. 
 So when they're faced with the problem of government, they don't care as much about using their voices. 
 They're using their hands. 
 They're using their hands to write applications that make government work better. 
 And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better. 
 That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed, turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it. 
 And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along, and many people do. 
 But these apps are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumers, and we're not just consumers of government, putting in our taxes and getting back services. 
 We're more than that, we're citizens. 
 And we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship. 
 So the question I have for all of you here: When it comes to the big, important things that we need to do together, all of us together, are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are we also going to be a crowd of hands? 
 Thank you. 
 Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be, and I thought that, since I was among friends here, I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it. 
 So I'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide. 
 And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on. 
 This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file. 
 What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide, but the general form of it. 
 This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of RISC microprocessors versus the power of local area networks. 
 And the interesting thing about it is that this slide, like so many technology slides that we're used to, is a sort of a straight line on a semi-log curve. 
 In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale. 
 And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi-log curves. 
 Something really weird is going on here. 
 And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about. 
 So, if you could bring up the lights. 
 If you could bring up the lights higher, because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here. 
 Now why do we draw technology curves in semi-log curves? 
 Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years, this is time of some sort, and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph, the graphs look sort of silly. 
 They sort of go like this. 
 And they don't tell us much. 
 Now if I graph, for instance, some other technology, say transportation technology, on a semi-log curve, it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line. 
 But when something like this happens, things are qualitatively changing. 
 So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology, then the day after tomorrow, I would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds. 
 It's not moving like that. 
 And there's nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years. 
 Now the question that I'd like to ask is, if you look at these exponential curves, they don't go on forever. 
 Things just can't possibly keep changing as fast as they are. 
 One of two things is going to happen. 
 Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this, until something totally different comes along, or maybe it's going to do this. 
 That's about all it can do. 
 Now I'm an optimist, so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that. 
 If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a transition. 
 We're sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is. 
 And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself, is what's this new way that the world is? 
 What's that new state that the world is heading toward? 
 Because the transition seems very, very confusing when we're right in the middle of it. 
 Now when I was a kid growing up, the future was kind of the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000. 
 Now here's a conference in which people talk about the future, and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000. 
 It's about as far as we go out. 
 So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime. 
 Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something's happening there. 
 That transition is happening. We can all sense it. 
 And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense to think out 30, 50 years because everything's going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing just doesn't make any sense at all. 
 So what I would like to talk about is what that could be, what that transition could be that we're going through. 
 Now in order to do that I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers. 
 Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things. 
 So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth. 
 So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time. 
 So if you go back about two and a half billion years, the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it. 
 And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized, we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it. 
 And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA, but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it, which is that, at that time, there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them. 
 And some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside And those that were like that started to split and divide. 
 And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense, those little drops of oil. 
 But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now, because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals. 
 And every time it divided, they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them. 
 And so every drop was a little bit different. 
 In fact, the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them, grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more. 
 So those tended to live longer, get expressed more. 
 Now that's sort of just a very simple chemical form of life, but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction. 
 Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand, these little drops learned to write down information. 
 They learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA. 
 So in other words, they worked out, in this mindless sort of evolutionary way, a form of writing that let them write down what they were, so that that way of writing it down could get copied. 
 The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago. 
 In fact the recipe for us, our genes, is exactly that same code and that same way of writing. 
 In fact, every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code. 
 In fact, one of the things that I did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code. 
 And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder, which I try not to let the security people see at airports. 
 But this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amplified it 10 to the 22 times. 
 So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card, I have plenty for everyone in the room, and, in fact, everyone in the world, and it's right here. 
 If I had really been a egotist, I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room. 
 So what was the next step? 
 Writing down the DNA was an interesting step. 
 And that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years. 
 But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different, which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information, so that they began to get communities of cells. 
 I don't know if you know this, but bacteria can actually exchange DNA. 
 Now that's why, for instance, antibiotic resistance has evolved. 
 Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin, and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria, and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate. 
 Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that, in some sense, were in the same boat together; they were synergistic. 
 So they survived or they failed together, which means that if a community was very successful, all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution. 
 Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that, in fact, they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA. 
 And so the next stage that's interesting in life took about another billion years. 
 And at that stage, we have multi-cellular communities, communities of lots of different types of cells, working together as a single organism. 
 And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community. 
 We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore. 
 Your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell, muscle cell, a brain cell and so on. 
 So these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell, but a community which we call an organism. 
 Now the next step that happened is within these communities. 
 These communities of cells, again, began to abstract information. 
 And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community. 
 And those are the neural structures. 
 So neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up. 
 And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording, understanding, learning information. 
 And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities. 
 And that gave them an evolutionary advantage. 
 Because at that point, an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism, instead of over this evolutionary time span. 
 So an organism could, for instance, learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it. 
 That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism, whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures, that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit. 
 So that nervous system, the fact that they built these special information structures, tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution. 
 Because evolution could now happen within an individual. 
 It could happen in learning time scales. 
 But then what happened was the individuals worked out, of course, tricks of communicating. 
 And for example, the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language. 
 It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it. 
 Here I have a very complicated, messy, confused idea in my head. 
 I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically, and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it. 
 But we're taking something very complicated, turning it into sound, sequences of sounds, and producing something very complicated in your brain. 
 So this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism. 
 And so, in fact, what we've done is we, humanity, have started abstracting out. 
 We're going through the same levels that multi-cellular organisms have gone through -- abstracting out our methods of recording, presenting, processing information. 
 So for example, the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction. 
 Telephony, computers, videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we've now built within our society for handling that information. 
 And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before. 
 So now, evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds. 
 And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Convolution program right before your eyes. 
 So now we've speeded up the time scales once again. 
 So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece. 
 And the next steps, like nervous systems and brains, took a few hundred million years. 
 Then the next steps, like language and so on, took less than a million years. 
 And these next steps, like electronics, seem to be taking only a few decades. 
 The process is feeding on itself and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change. 
 The more it changes, the faster it changes. 
 And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve. 
 We're seeing this process feeding back on itself. 
 Now I design computers for a living, and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers. 
 So right now, what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense. 
 I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does. 
 There are billions of them. 
 Instead, what I do and what the designers at Thinking Machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do, much farther and faster than we could ever do. 
 And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods that we don't quite even understand. 
 One method that's particularly interesting that I've been using a lot lately is evolution itself. 
 So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale. 
 So for example, in the most extreme cases, we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions. 
 Say, "Computer, would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions. 
 Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions, run all of those programs, and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted." 
 So in other words, I define what I wanted. 
 Let's say I want to sort numbers, as a simple example I've done it with. 
 So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers. 
 So of course, random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers, so none of them will really do it. 
 But one of them, by luck, may put two numbers in the right order. 
 And I say, "Computer, would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job. 
 Save those. Kill off the rest. 
 And now let's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best. 
 And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex." 
 Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines, and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs. 
 So I've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job. 
 Say, "Please repeat that process." 
 Score them again. 
 Introduce some mutations perhaps. 
 And try that again and do that for another generation. 
 Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds. 
 So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes, or in the complicated cases, in a few hours. 
 At the end of that, I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers. 
 In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand. 
 Now if I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work. 
 I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work. 
 They're obscure, weird programs. 
 But they do the job. 
 And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job. 
 In fact, their life depended on doing the job. 
 I was riding in a 747 with Marvin Minsky once, and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this. 
 It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight.' Doesn't that make you feel confident?" 
 In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well when it gets complicated. 
 So we're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that's very different than engineering. 
 And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce. 
 And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it. 
 So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us. 
 We're now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we'll be able to run this process much faster. 
 So it's feeding back on itself. 
 The thing is becoming faster and that's why I think it seems so confusing. 
 Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves. 
 We're taking off. 
 And what we are is we're at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms. 
 So we're the amoebas and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating. 
 We're right at that point of transition. 
 But I think that there really is something coming along after us. 
 I think it's very haughty of us to think that we're the end product of evolution. 
 And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is. 
 So lunch is coming along, and I think I will stop at that point, before I get selected out. 
 My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago. 
 I was in the desert, under the starry skies with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali. 
 And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata." 
 So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky. 
 Now we do the same with airplanes. 
 Back then, when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince, when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow, he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out. 
 Now we do the same with drills and machines. 
 The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery. 
 And this made me really sad. 
 I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe. 
 I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends. 
 And it felt like technology should enable magic, not kill it. 
 When I was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch. 
 And this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me. 
 It became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination. 
 So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming. 
 They stopped us from being inspired. 
 And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology, to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it. 
 I've been illustrating books since I was 16. 
 And so when I saw the iPad, I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world. 
 It can know how we're holding it. 
 It can know where we are. 
 It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch. 
 Storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial. 
 But what are we doing with it? 
 So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya, an interactive app for the iPad. 
 So it says, "Place your fingers upon each light." 
 And so -- It says, "This box belongs to ... " And so I type in my name. 
 And actually I become a character in the book. 
 At various points, a little letter drops down to me -- and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS -- which is actually addressed to me. 
 The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities. 
 Now I've been talking a lot about magic. 
 And I don't mean wizards and dragons, I mean the kind of childhood magic, those ideas that we all harbored as children. 
 This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason, was always really exciting to me. 
 And so over here you need to tilt your iPad, take the fireflies out. 
 And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book. 
 Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble. 
 And so over here, each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device. 
 And it opens up a map. 
 All along, all fantasy books have always had maps, but these maps have been static. 
 This is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book. 
 It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well. 
 So I'm just going to enter in. 
 Another thing that's actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary. 
 Over here, these are the Apsaras. 
 So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs, but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras? 
 These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book. 
 And so we're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children. 
 And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis. 
 Speaking of the environmental crisis, I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms, glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out. 
 But now with mobile technology, we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology. 
 One of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside, take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects. 
 When I was a child, I had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells. 
 And somehow kids don't do that anymore. 
 So in bringing back this childhood ritual, you need to go out and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower and then tag it. 
 In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that. 
 And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online. 
 A child in London puts up a picture of a fox and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today." 
 A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today." 
 And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you've actually taken. 
 In the possibilities of linking together magic, the earth and technology, there are multiple possibilities. 
 In the next book, we plan on having an interaction where you take your iPad out with the video on and through augmented reality, you see this layer of animated pixies appear on a houseplant that's outside your house. 
 At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves. 
 And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book. 
 We're moving, we're all moving here, to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology, and magic and technology can come closer together. 
 We're harnessing energy from the sun. 
 We're bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story. 
 Thank you. 
 Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me. 
 I spend most of my time in jails, in prisons, on death row. 
 I spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness. 
 And being here at TED and seeing the stimulation, hearing it, has been very, very energizing to me. 
 And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity. 
 And you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world. 
 And sometimes when it comes through TED, it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't. 
 And I mention that because I think identity is really important. 
 And we've had some fantastic presentations. 
 And I think what we've learned is that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful, but if you're a compassionate teacher, they can be especially meaningful. 
 If you're a doctor you can do some good things, but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things. 
 And so I want to talk about the power of identity. 
 And I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do. 
 I actually learned about this from my grandmother. 
 I grew up in a house that was the traditional African American home that was dominated by a matriarch, and that matriarch was my grandmother. 
 She was tough, she was strong, she was powerful. 
 She was the end of every argument in our family. 
 She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family. 
 She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved. 
 Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's. 
 She was born in the 1880's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world. 
 And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving. 
 When I would see her as a little boy, she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs. 
 And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go. 
 And an hour or two later, if I saw her, she'd come over to me and she'd say, "Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?" 
 And if I said, "No," she'd assault me again, and if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone. 
 And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her. 
 And the only challenge was that she had 10 children. 
 My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids. 
 And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her, it would be difficult to get her time and attention. 
 My cousins would be running around everywhere. 
 And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old, waking up one morning, going into the living room, and all of my cousins were running around. 
 And my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me. 
 And at first I thought we were playing a game. 
 And I would look at her and I'd smile, but she was very serious. 
 And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this, she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said, "Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk." 
 And I remember this just like it happened yesterday. 
 I never will forget it. 
 She took me out back and she said, "Bryan, I'm going to tell you something, but you don't tell anybody what I tell you." 
 I said, "Okay, Mama." 
 She said, "Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "Sure." 
 Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said, "I want you to know I've been watching you." 
 And she said, "I think you're special." 
 She said, "I think you can do anything you want to do." 
 I will never forget it. 
 And then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan." 
 I said, "Okay, Mama." 
 She said, "The first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom." 
 She said, "That's my baby girl, and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her." 
 Well I adored my mom, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that." 
 Then she said, "The second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing." 
 And I thought about it and I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that." 
 Then finally she said, "The third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol." 
 Well I was nine years old, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that." 
 I grew up in the country in the rural South, and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger. 
 When I was about 14 or 15, one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer -- I don't know where he got it -- and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods. 
 And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did. 
 And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some, and they offered it to me. 
 I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer." 
 My brother said, "Come on. We're doing this today; you always do what we do. 
 I had some, your sister had some. Have some beer." 
 I said, "No, I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead." 
 And then my brother started staring at me. 
 He said, "What's wrong with you? Have some beer." 
 Then he looked at me real hard and he said, "Oh, I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you." 
 I said, "Well, what are you talking about?" 
 He said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special." 
 I was devastated. 
 And I'm going to admit something to you. 
 I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't. 
 I know this might be broadcast broadly. 
 But I'm 52 years old, and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol. 
 I don't say that because I think that's virtuous; I say that because there is power in identity. 
 When we create the right kind of identity, we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe makes sense. 
 We can get them to do things that they don't think they can do. 
 When I thought about my grandmother, of course she would think all her grandkids were special. 
 My grandfather was in prison during prohibition. 
 My male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases. 
 And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to. 
 Well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system. 
 This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago. 
 In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons. 
 Today, there are 2.3 million. 
 The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. 
 We have seven million people on probation and parole. 
 And mass incarceration, in my judgment, has fundamentally changed our world. 
 In poor communities, in communities of color there is this despair, there is this hopelessness, that is being shaped by these outcomes. 
 One out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole. 
 In urban communities across this country -- Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole. 
 Our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race, they're also distorted by poverty. 
 We have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. 
 Wealth, not culpability, shapes outcomes. 
 And yet, we seem to be very comfortable. 
 The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems. 
 We've been disconnected. 
 It's interesting to me. 
 We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work. 
 My state of Alabama, like a number of states, actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction. 
 Right now in Alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote. 
 We're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. 
 And there is this stunning silence. 
 I represent children. 
 A lot of my clients are very young. 
 The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison. 
 We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country. 
 And we're actually doing some litigation. 
 The only country in the world. 
 I represent people on death row. 
 It's interesting, this question of the death penalty. 
 In many ways, we've been taught to think that the real question is, do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed? 
 And that's a very sensible question. 
 But there's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity. 
 The other way of thinking about it is not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit, but do we deserve to kill? 
 I mean, it's fascinating. 
 Death penalty in America is defined by error. 
 For every nine people who have been executed, we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death row. 
 A kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent. 
 I mean, it's fascinating. 
 In aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash. 
 But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem. 
 It's not our problem. 
 It's not our burden. 
 It's not our struggle. 
 I talk a lot about these issues. 
 I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill. 
 And it's interesting, when I teach my students about African American history, I tell them about slavery. 
 I tell them about terrorism, the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II. 
 We don't really know very much about it. 
 But for African Americans in this country, that was an era defined by terror. 
 In many communities, people had to worry about being lynched. 
 They had to worry about being bombed. 
 It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives. 
 And these older people come up to me now and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches, you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after 9/11." 
 They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that." 
 And that era of terrorism, of course, was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid. 
 And yet, we have in this country this dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems. 
 We don't like to talk about our history. 
 And because of that, we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically. 
 We're constantly running into each other. 
 We're constantly creating tensions and conflicts. 
 We have a hard time talking about race, and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation. 
 In South Africa, people understood that we couldn't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation. 
 In Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment, but in this country we haven't done that. 
 I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty. 
 It was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said, "Well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about." 
 He said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany. 
 And of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany." 
 And the room got very quiet, and this woman said, "There's no way, with our history, we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings. 
 It would be unconscionable for us to, in an intentional and deliberate way, set about executing people." 
 And I thought about that. 
 What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people, especially if they were disproportionately Jewish? 
 I couldn't bear it. 
 It would be unconscionable. 
 And yet, in this country, in the states of the Old South, we execute people -- where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black, 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched. 
 And yet, there is this disconnect. 
 Well I believe that our identity is at risk. 
 That when we actually don't care about these difficult things, the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated. 
 We love innovation. 
 We love technology. We love creativity. 
 We love entertainment. 
 But ultimately, those realities are shadowed by suffering, abuse, degradation, marginalization. 
 And for me, it becomes necessary to integrate the two. 
 Because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful, more committed, more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world. 
 And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor, the disadvantaged, those who will never get to TED. 
 But thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives. 
 You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen. 
 We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are. 
 Innovation, creativity, development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone. 
 They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart. 
 And it's that mind-heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things, but also the dark and difficult things. 
 Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this. 
 He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression, we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, an orientation of the spirit, a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness." 
 Well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in. 
 There is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering, to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice. 
 Now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this. 
 It will get to you. 
 I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks. 
 And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then, and she would get together with two of her dearest friends, these older women, Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott -- amazing African American woman -- and Virginia Durr, a white woman, whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King. 
 And these women would get together and just talk. 
 And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me, and she'd say, "Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk. 
 Do you want to come over and listen?" 
 And I'd say, "Yes, Ma'am, I do." 
 And she'd say, "Well what are you going to do when you get here?" 
 I said, "I'm going to listen." 
 And I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen. 
 It would be so energizing and so empowering. 
 And one time I was over there listening to these women talk, and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is. 
 Tell me what you're trying to do." 
 And I began giving her my rap. 
 I said, "Well we're trying to challenge injustice. 
 We're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted. 
 We're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice. 
 We're trying to end life without parole sentences for children. 
 We're trying to do something about the death penalty. 
 We're trying to reduce the prison population. 
 We're trying to end mass incarceration." 
 I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm." 
 She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired." 
 And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face, she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave." 
 And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more courageous. 
 We need to find ways to embrace these challenges, these problems, the suffering. 
 Because ultimately, our humanity depends on everyone's humanity. 
 I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do. 
 It's just taught me very simple things. 
 I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done. 
 I believe that for every person on the planet. 
 I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar. 
 I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them, they're not just a thief. 
 I think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer. 
 And because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law. 
 I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of this globe, that the opposite of poverty is not wealth. 
 I don't believe that. 
 I actually think, in too many places, the opposite of poverty is justice. 
 And finally, I believe that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating, we will ultimately not be judged by our technology, we won't be judged by our design, we won't be judged by our intellect and reason. 
 Ultimately, you judge the character of a society, not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged, but by how they treat the poor, the condemned, the incarcerated. 
 Because it's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are. 
 I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story. 
 I sometimes push too hard. 
 I do get tired, as we all do. 
 Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important. 
 And I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences. 
 And I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14, and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult. 
 I start thinking, well, how did that happen? 
 How can a judge turn you into something that you're not? 
 And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid. 
 And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking, well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not, the judge must have magic power. 
 Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power. 
 You should ask for some of that. 
 And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight, I started working on a motion. 
 And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid. 
 And I started working on this motion, and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor, 14-year-old black male client like a privileged, white 75-year-old corporate executive." 
 And I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct. 
 There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county, it's all misconduct. 
 And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion, or did I actually write it? 
 And to my horror, not only had I written it, but I had sent it to court. 
 A couple months went by, and I had just forgotten all about it. 
 And I finally decided, oh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case. 
 And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed. 
 And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse. 
 And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful. 
 And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse. 
 And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse, there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse. 
 When this man saw me, he came over to me and he said, "Who are you?" 
 I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir." 
 And this man came over to me and he hugged me. 
 And he whispered in my ear. 
 He said, "I'm so proud of you." 
 And I have to tell you, it was energizing. 
 It connected deeply with something in me about identity, about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community, to a perspective that is hopeful. 
 Well I went into the courtroom. 
 And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in. 
 He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?" 
 I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing. 
 And people started coming in because they were just outraged. 
 I had written these crazy things. 
 And police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers. 
 And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race, that we were talking about poverty, that we were talking about inequality. 
 And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth. 
 And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler. 
 He kept pacing back and forth. 
 And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me, almost at counsel table. 
 About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break. 
 And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court. 
 And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man. 
 He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?" 
 And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this courtroom to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on." 
 I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice. 
 That we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity. 
 That all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone. 
 That our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity, compassion and justice. 
 And more than anything, for those of you who share that, I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on. 
 Thank you very much. 
 So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience, this community, to help you on your way and to do something on this issue. 
 Other than writing a check, what could we do? 
 Well there are opportunities all around us. 
 If you live in the state of California, for example, there's a referendum coming up this spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment. 
 For example, here in California we're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars. 
 And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases don't result in arrest. 
 56 percent of all rape cases don't result. 
 So there's an opportunity to change that. 
 And this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety. 
 And I think that opportunity exists all around us. 
 There's been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades. 
 And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates. 
 What would you say to someone who believed that? 
 Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable. 
 The great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories. 
 It was this misguided war on drugs. 
 That's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population. 
 And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment. 
 And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes, rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized. 
 I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime, not do less. 
 And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one. 
 And I think that's the orientation that we have to change. 
 Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here. 
 You're an inspiring person. 
 Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you. 
 Threats, in the wake of Bin Laden's death, have spiked. 
 Famine in Somalia. Police pepper spray. 
 Vicious cartels. Announcer Five: Caustic cruise lines. 
 Societal decay. 65 dead. 
 Tsunami warning. Cyber-attacks. 
 Drug war. Mass destruction. Tornado. 
 Recession. Default. Doomsday. Egypt. Syria. 
 Crisis. Death. Disaster. 
 Oh, my God. 
 So those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years. 
 The point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that's what our minds pay attention to. 
 And there's a very good reason for that. 
 Every second of every day, our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains. 
 And because nothing is more important to us than survival, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala. 
 Now the amygdala is our early warning detector, our danger detector. 
 It sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us. 
 So given a dozen news stories, we will preferentially look at the negative news. 
 And that old newspaper saying, "If it bleeds it leads," is very true. 
 So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we're pessimistic. 
 It's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse. 
 But perhaps that's not the case. 
 Perhaps instead, it's the distortions brought to us of what's really going on. 
 Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are, in fact, accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance. 
 Now I'm not saying we don't have our set of problems -- climate crisis, species extinction, water and energy shortage -- we surely do. 
 And as humans, we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance, but ultimately we knock them down. 
 So let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're going. 
 Over the last hundred years, the average human lifespan has more than doubled, average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled. 
 Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10. 
 Add to that the cost of food, electricity, transportation, communication have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold. 
 Steve Pinker has showed us that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history. 
 And Charles Kenny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years. 
 We truly are living in an extraordinary time. 
 And many people forget this. 
 And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher. 
 In fact, we redefine what poverty means. 
 Think of this, in America today, the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile phones, air conditioning and cars. 
 The wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet, could have never dreamed of such luxuries. 
 Underpinning much of this is technology, and of late, exponentially growing technologies. 
 My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law, and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months. 
 That's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s. 
 Now look at this curve. 
 This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years. 
 I want you to notice two things from this curve. 
 Number one, how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time, war time and peace time, recession, depression and boom time. 
 This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers. 
 It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges. 
 And also, even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left, it's curving upwards. 
 The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster. 
 And on this curve, riding on Moore's Law, are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us. 
 Cloud computing, what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing; sensors and networks; robotics; 3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet; synthetic biology; fuels, vaccines and foods; digital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I. 
 I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy by IBM's Watson? 
 I mean, that was epic. 
 In fact, I scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could. 
 And I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents." 
 Jeopardy's not an easy game. 
 It's about the nuance of human language. 
 And imagine if you would A.I.'s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone. 
 Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University. 
 And we teach our students all of these technologies, and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity's grand challenges. 
 And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade. 
 Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today. 
 30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous. 
 Today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that. 
 When I think about creating abundance, it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet; it's about creating a life of possibility. 
 It is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant. 
 You see, scarcity is contextual, and technology is a resource-liberating force. 
 Let me give you an example. 
 So this is a story of Napoleon III in the mid-1800s. 
 He's the dude on the left. 
 He invited over to dinner the king of Siam. 
 All of Napoleon's troops were fed with silver utensils, Napoleon himself with gold utensils. 
 But the King of Siam, he was fed with aluminum utensils. 
 You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, worth more than gold and platinum. 
 It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum. 
 You see, even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass, it doesn't come as a pure metal. 
 It's all bound by oxygen and silicates. 
 But then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw-away mentality. 
 So let's project this analogy going forward. 
 We think about energy scarcity. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year. 
 16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface every 88 minutes. 
 It's not about being scarce, it's about accessibility. 
 And there's good news here. 
 For the first time, this year the cost of solar-generated electricity is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India -- 8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees. 
 The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year. 
 Last month, MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average. 
 And if we have abundant energy, we also have abundant water. 
 Now we talk about water wars. 
 Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth, in 1990 after it just passed Saturn? 
 He took a famous photo. What was it called? 
 "A Pale Blue Dot." 
 Because we live on a water planet. 
 We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water. 
 Yes, 97.5 percent is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet, but here too there is hope. 
 And there is technology coming online, not 10, 20 years from now, right now. 
 There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials. 
 And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the great DIY innovators, I'd like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of, it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator. 
 It's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source -- saltwater, polluted water, latrine -- at less than two cents a liter. 
 The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world. 
 And if that pans out, which I have every confidence it will, Coca-Cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet. 
 This is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology, that exists today. 
 And we've seen this in cellphones. 
 My goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013. 
 Think about it, that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile comm than President Reagan did 25 years ago. 
 And if they're on a smartphone on Google, they've got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago. 
 They're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted. 
 Better than that, the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- GPS, HD video and still images, libraries of books and music, medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone. 
 Probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health. 
 Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize. 
 We're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to, because it's got A.I., you can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick. 
 And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors. 
 So literally, imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers. 
 When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn't recognize, it calls the CDC and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place. 
 But here, here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance. 
 I call it the rising billion. 
 So the white lines here are population. 
 We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth. 
 And by the way, the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy. 
 In 2010, we had just short of two billion people online, connected. 
 By 2020, that's going from two billion to five billion Internet users. 
 Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation. 
 What will these people want? 
 What will they consume? What will they desire? 
 And rather than having economic shutdown, we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever. 
 These people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy. 
 And they will get healthier by using the Tricorder, and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy, and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infinite computing [become] more productive than ever before. 
 So what could three billion rising, healthy, educated, productive members of humanity bring to us? 
 How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before. 
 What about giving the oppressed, wherever they might be, the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever? 
 What will these three billion people bring? 
 What about contributions we can't even predict? 
 The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things, things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past. 
 Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited. 
 There is a program that some of you might have heard of. 
 It's a game called Foldit. 
 It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle. 
 And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold. 
 And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality. 
 And it's very important for research in medicine. 
 And up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem. 
 And this game has been played by university professors and so forth. 
 And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it. 
 And it showed that, in fact, today, the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers. 
 And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a CalTech student, it was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein folder. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet. 
 We have the tools with this exponential technology. 
 We have the passion of the DIY innovator. 
 We have the capital of the techno-philanthropist. 
 And we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges, to do that which we must do. 
 We are living into extraordinary decades ahead. 
 Thank you. 
 I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change. 
 And I think it starts with one physician, and that's me. 
 And maybe I've been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that. 
 Before I actually begin the meat of my talk, let's begin with a bit of baseball. 
 Hey, why not? 
 We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series. 
 We all love baseball, don't we? 
 Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics. 
 And there's hundreds of them. 
 "Moneyball" is about to come out, and it's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team. 
 I'm going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of. 
 It's called batting average. 
 So we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300. 
 That means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely three times out of 10 at bats. 
 That means hit the ball into the outfield, it dropped, it didn't get caught, and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time and the runner was safe. 
 Three times out of 10. 
 Do you know what they call a 300 hitter in Major League Baseball? 
 Good, really good, maybe an all-star. 
 Do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter? 
 That's somebody who hit, by the way, four times safely out of every 10. 
 Legendary -- as in Ted Williams legendary -- the last Major League Baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season. 
 Now let's take this back into my world of medicine where I'm a lot more comfortable, or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I'm going to talk to you about. 
 Suppose you have appendicitis and you're referred to a surgeon who's batting 400 on appendectomies. 
 Somehow this isn't working out, is it? 
 Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who's batting 200 on angioplasties. 
 But, but, you know what? 
 She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail. 
 And she's hitting a 257. 
 Somehow this isn't working. 
 But I'm going to ask you a question. 
 What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon, an OBGYN, a paramedic is supposed to be? 
 1,000, very good. 
 Now truth of the matter is, nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat. 
 What we do though is we send each one of them, including myself, out into the world with the admonition, be perfect. 
 Never ever, ever make a mistake, but you worry about the details, about how that's going to happen. 
 And that was the message that I absorbed when I was in med school. 
 I was an obsessive compulsive student. 
 In high school, a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test. 
 And so I did. 
 And I studied in my little garret at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital, not far from here. 
 And I memorized everything. 
 I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle, every branch of every artery that came off the aorta, differential diagnoses obscure and common. 
 I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis. 
 And all the while, I was amassing more and more knowledge. 
 And I did well, I graduated with honors, cum laude. 
 And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything, or as much as possible, as close to everything as possible, that it would immunize me against making mistakes. 
 And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. Drucker. 
 I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working. 
 At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation. 
 And it was my job, when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult, to see that patient in emerg. 
 and to report back to my attending. 
 And I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless. 
 And when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound. 
 And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope, I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure. 
 This is a condition in which the heart fails, and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward, some of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood, and that's why you have shortness of breath. 
 And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make. 
 I made it and I set to work treating her. 
 I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart. 
 I gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills, to get her to pee out the access fluid. 
 And over the course of the next hour and a half or two, she started to feel better. 
 And I felt really good. 
 And that's when I made my first mistake; I sent her home. 
 Actually, I made two more mistakes. 
 I sent her home without speaking to my attending. 
 I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do, which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself. 
 And he knew her, he would have been able to furnish additional information about her. 
 Maybe I did it for a good reason. 
 Maybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident. 
 Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients without even having to contact him. 
 The second mistake that I made was worse. 
 In sending her home, I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me, "Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this." 
 In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker, "Do you think it's okay if she goes home?" 
 And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly, "Yeah, I think she'll do okay." 
 I can remember that like it was yesterday. 
 So I signed the discharge papers, and an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home. 
 And I went back to my work on the wards. 
 All the rest of that day, that afternoon, I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach. 
 But I carried on with my work. 
 And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do. 
 I walked through the emergency department on my way home. 
 And it was there that another nurse, not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse, said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread. 
 Others in medicine dread them as well, but there's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly. 
 The three words are: Do you remember? 
 "Do you remember that patient you sent home?" 
 the other nurse asked matter-of-factly. 
 "Well she's back," in just that tone of voice. 
 Well she was back all right. 
 She was back and near death. 
 About an hour after she had arrived home, after I'd sent her home, she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shock. 
 And she was barely breathing and she was blue. 
 And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops. 
 They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure. 
 They put her on a ventilator. 
 And I was shocked and shaken to the core. 
 And I went through this roller coaster, because after they stabilized her, she went to the intensive care unit, and I hoped against hope that she would recover. 
 And over the next two or three days, it was clear that she was never going to wake up. 
 She had irreversible brain damage. 
 And the family gathered. 
 And over the course of the next eight or nine days, they resigned themselves to what was happening. 
 And at about the nine day mark, they let her go -- Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother. 
 They say you never forget the names of those who die. 
 And that was my first time to be acquainted with that. 
 Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you can't talk about it with your colleagues. 
 You know that healthy kind, when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions, but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say, I'll never make that mistake again. 
 And you make amends and you never make that mistake again. 
 That's the kind of shame that is a teacher. 
 The unhealthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside. 
 It's the one that says, not that what you did was bad, but that you are bad. 
 And it was what I was feeling. 
 And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll. 
 He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued. 
 And I kept asking myself these questions. 
 Why didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home? 
 And then at my worst moments: Why did I make such a stupid mistake? 
 Why did I go into medicine? 
 Slowly but surely, it lifted. 
 I began to feel a bit better. 
 And on a cloudy day, there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered, maybe I could feel better again. 
 And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop. 
 And they did. 
 And I went back to work. 
 And then it happened again. 
 Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto, and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat. 
 It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry. 
 He kept pointing here. 
 I looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink. 
 And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way. 
 And even as he was walking out the door, he was still sort of pointing to his throat. 
 And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office. 
 And she said the three words: Do you remember? 
 "Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?" 
 Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat. 
 He had a potentially life-threatening condition called epiglottitis. 
 You can Google it, but it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway, and it can actually cause the airway to close. 
 And fortunately he didn't die. 
 He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days. 
 And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again. 
 Twice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis. 
 Now that takes some doing, especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night. 
 Now in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their care. 
 One I thought had a kidney stone. 
 I ordered a kidney X-ray. When it turned out to be normal, my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons. 
 The other one had a lot of diarrhea. 
 I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him. 
 And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons. 
 In both cases, they had their operations and they did okay. 
 But each time, they were gnawing at me, eating at me. 
 And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S. 
 Some of my doozies have been in the last five years. 
 Alone, ashamed and unsupported. 
 Here's the problem: If I can't come clean and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the still-small voice that tells me what really happened, how can I share it with my colleagues? 
 How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing? 
 If I were to walk into a room -- like right now, I have no idea what you think of me. 
 When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure? 
 Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes. 
 If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I've just told you right now, I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable, somebody would crack a joke, they'd change the subject and we would move on. 
 And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital, believe me, I'd have trouble making eye contact with that person. 
 That's the system that we have. 
 It's a complete denial of mistakes. 
 It's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don't, those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can, those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes. 
 And it's almost like an ideological reaction, like the antibodies begin to attack that person. 
 And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine, what will we be left with, but a safe system. 
 But there are two problems with that. 
 In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism, I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can, from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show "White Coat, Black Art." 
 is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous. 
 We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage, where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous, causing havoc and death. 
 In this country, as many as 24,000 Canadians die of preventable medical errors. 
 In the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000. 
 In both cases, these are gross underestimates, because we really aren't ferreting out the problem as we should. 
 And here's the thing. 
 In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years, we can't keep up with it. 
 Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive. 
 We can't get rid of it. 
 We have our cognitive biases, so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain. 
 Now take the same patient with chest pain, make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath, and suddenly my history is laced with contempt. 
 I don't take the same history. 
 I'm not a robot; I don't do things the same way each time. 
 And my patients aren't cars; they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time. 
 Given all of that, mistakes are inevitable. 
 So if you take the system, as I was taught, and weed out all the error-prone health professionals, well there won't be anybody left. 
 And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases? 
 On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art," I made it a habit of saying, "Here's my worst mistake," I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery, "Here's my worst mistake," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, "What about yours?" and I would point the microphone towards them. 
 And their pupils would dilate, they would recoil, then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories. 
 They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories. 
 They want to be able to say, "Look, don't make the same mistake I did." 
 What they need is an environment to be able to do that. 
 What they need is a redefined medical culture. 
 And it starts with one physician at a time. 
 The redefined physician is human, knows she's human, accepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes, but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else. 
 She shares her experience with others. 
 She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes. 
 And she points out other people's mistakes, not in a gotcha way, but in a loving, supportive way so that everybody can benefit. 
 And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system, and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time. 
 So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving, supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes, we're rewarded for coming clean. 
 My name is Brian Goldman. 
 I am a redefined physician. 
 I'm human. I make mistakes. 
 I'm sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people. 
 I still don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that. 
 And let me close with three words of my own: I do remember. 
 I'm going to speak about a tiny, little idea. 
 And this is about shifting baseline. 
 And because the idea can be explained in one minute, I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time. 
 And the first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes. 
 And he was here, as you well know, in '35. 
 And you'd think he was chasing finches, but he wasn't. 
 He was actually collecting fish. 
 And he described one of them as very "common." 
 This was the sailfin grouper. 
 A big fishery was run on it until the '80s. 
 Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List. 
 Now this story, we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places, so there is nothing particular about it. 
 But the point is, we still come to Galapagos. 
 We still think it is pristine. 
 The brochures still say it is untouched. 
 So what happens here? 
 The second story, also to illustrate another concept, is called shifting waistline. 
 Because I was there in '71, studying a lagoon in West Africa. 
 I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa. 
 And I thought I could blend in. 
 And I got a big sunburn, and I was convinced that I was really not from there. 
 This was my first sunburn. 
 And the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees, as you can see, and a few mangrove. 
 And it had tilapia about 20 centimeters, a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia. 
 And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana. 
 When I went there 27 years later, the fish had shrunk to half of their size. 
 They were maturing at five centimeters. 
 They had been pushed genetically. 
 There were still fishes. 
 They were still kind of happy. 
 And the fish also were happy to be there. 
 So nothing has changed, but everything has changed. 
 My third little story is that I was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in Southeast Asia. 
 In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s -- Europe did lots of development projects. 
 Fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000 fishers to impose on them industrial fishing. 
 And this boat, quite ugly, is called the Mutiara 4. 
 And I went sailing on it, and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea. 
 And what we caught, we didn't have words for it. 
 What we caught, I know now, is the bottom of the sea. 
 And 90 percent of our catch were sponges, other animals that are fixed on the bottom. 
 And actually most of the fish, they are a little spot on the debris, the piles of debris, were coral reef fish. 
 Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down. 
 And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid. 
 Within a year, you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins. 
 The bottom is transformed from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess. 
 This is a dead turtle. 
 They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead. 
 And one time we caught a live one. 
 It was not drowned yet. 
 And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat. 
 This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that's never been fished. 
 But it's not documented. 
 We transform the world, but we don't remember it. 
 We adjust our baseline to the new level, and we don't recall what was there. 
 If you generalize this, something like this happens. 
 You have on the y axis some good thing: biodiversity, numbers of orca, the greenness of your country, the water supply. 
 And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things, or naturally. 
 Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward. 
 And the difference then, they perceive as a loss. 
 But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss. 
 You can have a succession of changes. 
 At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers. 
 And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now. 
 We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were. 
 Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies, they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations. 
 Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant, before it gets extinct, it becomes rare. 
 So you don't lose abundant animals. 
 You always lose rare animals. 
 And therefore they're not perceived as a big loss. 
 Over time, we concentrate on large animals, and in a sea that means the big fish. 
 They become rarer because we fish them. 
 Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline. 
 And the question is, why do people accept this? 
 Well because they don't know that it was different. 
 And in fact, lots of people, scientists, will contest that it was really different. 
 And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented. 
 For example, the anecdote that some present, as Captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists, because it's not "scientific." 
 So you have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in literate societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past. 
 And hence, the enormous role that a marine protected area can play. 
 Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreate the past. 
 We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low. 
 That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides, which enables them to reset their baseline. 
 How about the people who can't do that because they have no access -- the people in the Midwest for example? 
 There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap, and simulation. 
 This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay. 
 There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago. 
 And you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like "Avatar." 
 And if you think about "Avatar," if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the Pocahontas story -- why so touched by the imagery? 
 Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost. 
 And so my recommendation, it's the only one I will provide, is for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater. 
 Thank you very much. 
 In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany, if you owned a typewriter, you had to register it with the government. 
 You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter. 
 And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from. 
 If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought, they could track down who created that thought. 
 And we in the West couldn't understand how anybody could do this, how much this would restrict freedom of speech. 
 We would never do that in our own countries. 
 But today in 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer. 
 This is happening to us today. 
 And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it. 
 And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us, the citizens. 
 And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today. 
 If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world, we can group the attacks based on the attackers. 
 We have three main groups. 
 We have online criminals. 
 Like here, we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine. 
 And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand. 
 These guys make money. 
 They use online attacks to make lots of money, and lots and lots of it. 
 We actually have several cases of millionaires online, multimillionaires, who made money with their attacks. 
 Here's Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia. 
 This is Alfred Gonzalez. 
 This is Stephen Watt. 
 This is Bjorn Sundin. 
 This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on. 
 These guys make their fortunes online, but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking, or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer. 
 The U.S. Secret Service, two months ago, froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen. 
 Mr. Jain himself is on the loose; nobody knows where he is. 
 And I claim it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world. 
 And it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse. 
 In the future, the majority of crime will be happening online. 
 The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money. 
 They're motivated by something else -- motivated by protests, motivated by an opinion, motivated by the laughs. 
 Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks. 
 So those are the three main attackers: criminals who do it for the money, hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest, but then the last group are nation states, governments doing the attacks. 
 And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar. 
 This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens. 
 DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands -- or actually, it was. 
 It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into. 
 Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly. 
 And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack. 
 And his answer was yes. 
 So how do people die as the result of a hack like this? 
 Well DigiNotar is a C.A. 
 They sell certificates. 
 What do you do with certificates? 
 Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https, SSL encrypted services, services like Gmail. 
 Now we all, or a big part of us, use Gmail or one of their competitors, but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran, where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections, so the local government can't snoop on their discussions. 
 Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A. 
 and issue rogue certificates. 
 And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar. 
 What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt? 
 Well in Egypt, the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers. 
 Among those papers, was this binder entitled "FINFISHER." 
 And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country. 
 They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government. 
 The company headquarters are right here. 
 So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens. 
 But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well. 
 For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found, which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens. 
 If you are a suspect in a criminal case, well it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped. 
 But today, it goes beyond that. 
 They will tap your Internet connection. 
 They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan, which enables them to watch all your communication, to listen to your online discussions, to collect your passwords. 
 Now when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be that, "Okay, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen. 
 Why should I worry? 
 Because I have nothing to hide." 
 And this is an argument, which doesn't make sense. 
 Privacy is implied. 
 Privacy is not up for discussion. 
 This is not a question between privacy against security. 
 It's a question of freedom against control. 
 And while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011, any right we give away will be given away for good. 
 And do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government, a government we might have 50 years from now? 
 And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years. 
 This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block. 
 The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea: modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together. 
 Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world. 
 They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us, buildings, bridges, one brick at a time. 
 Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time. 
 Almost a hundred years later in 1947, LEGO came up with this. 
 It was called the Automatic Binding Brick. 
 And in a few short years, LEGO bricks took place in every household. 
 It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet. 
 You don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings. 
 LEGO made it accessible. 
 LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination. 
 Meanwhile the exact same year, at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced, the next building block. 
 The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive. 
 Like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to build much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time. 
 But there's a main difference: The transistor was only for experts. 
 I personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reserved for experts, so I decided to change that. 
 Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers. 
 A few years ago I started developing littleBits. 
 Let me show you how they work. 
 LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function. 
 They're pre-engineered to be light, sound, motors and sensors. 
 And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets. 
 So you can't put them the wrong way. 
 The bricks are color-coded. 
 Green is output, blue is power, pink is input and orange is wire. 
 So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits. 
 You put a blue to a green, you can make light. 
 You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer. 
 Switch out the knob for a pulse module, which is here, and now you've made a little blinker. 
 Add this buzzer for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine. 
 I'm going to stop that. 
 So beyond simple play, littleBits are actually pretty powerful. 
 Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder, littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures. 
 So to make this blink faster or slower, you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower. 
 The idea behind littleBits is that it's a growing library. 
 We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick. 
 Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors -- everything should be accessible. 
 We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them. 
 And it's been an incredible experience. 
 The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools. 
 For example, how a nightlight works, or why an elevator door stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch. 
 We've also been taking littleBits to design schools. 
 So for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material. 
 Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles, we have Geordie making ... 
 A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something." 
 Here's an example of a project they made, a motion-activated confetti canon ball. 
 But wait, this is actually my favorite project. 
 It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark. 
 To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material, electronics became just another material. 
 And we want to make this material accessible to everyone. 
 So littleBits is open-source. 
 You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself. 
 We want to encourage a world of creators, of inventors, of contributors, because this world that we live in, this interactive world, is ours. 
 So go ahead and start inventing. 
 Thank you. 
 Throughout the history of computers we've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information, the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild. 
 And this gap has become shorter, shorter, and even shorter, and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter, the thickness of a touch-screen glass, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone. 
 But I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all? 
 I started to imagine what this would look like. 
 First, I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space, so when you press it hard on the screen, it transfers its physical body into pixels. 
 Designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen. 
 So with this tool, this boundary has been broken. 
 But our two hands still remain outside the screen. 
 How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands? 
 At Microsoft Applied Sciences, along with my mentor Cati Boulanger, I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace. 
 By combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face, now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this 3D space and grab pixels with your bare hands. 
 Because windows and files have a position in the real space, selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf. 
 Then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines, words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window. 
 Architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly. 
 So in these examples, we are reaching into the digital world. 
 But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead? 
 I'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online. 
 But now you don't have to worry about it. 
 What I got here is an online augmented fitting room. 
 This is a view that you get from head-mounted or see-through display when the system understands the geometry of your body. 
 Taking this idea further, I started to think, instead of just seeing these pixels in our space, how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it? 
 What would such a future look like? 
 At MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Rehmi Post, we created this one physical pixel. 
 Well, in this case, this spherical magnet acts like a 3D pixel in our space, which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3D space. 
 What we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies. 
 And by digitally programming the object, we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space, which means that now, human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world. 
 So choreography can be taught physically over distance and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality. 
 Students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion, physics, and unlike computer screens or textbooks, this is a real, tangible experience that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful. 
 And what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities. 
 As you can see, the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world. 
 Today, we started by talking about the boundary, but if we remove this boundary, the only boundary left is our imagination. 
 Thank you. 
 So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s. 
 When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid. 
 But my tiger mother said, "No." 
 My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them. 
 After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness: a safe and well-paid job. 
 It is not important if I like the job or not. 
 But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer. 
 That is me playing my imaginary piano. 
 An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school. 
 I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show. 
 But no adults liked the idea. 
 No adults believed I was serious. 
 Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, just as powerless as I was. 
 So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained. 
 My dream would never come true. 
 I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for. 
 But that's so unfair. 
 So I was determined to find another calling. 
 Nobody around to teach me? Fine. 
 I turned to books. 
 I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"] I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"] And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"] And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these. 
 ["Complete Works of Sanmao" ] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin] I came to the U.S. in 1995, so which books did I read here first? 
 Books banned in China, of course. 
 "The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life. 
 That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it. 
 The Bible is interesting, but strange. 
 That's a topic for a different day. 
 But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany: "You shall honor your father and mother." 
 "Honor," I said. "That's so different, and better, than obey." 
 So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. 
 Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading. 
 It offers many insights. 
 For example, I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with. 
 It had never occurred to me, China doesn't have to be at the center of the world. 
 A map actually carries somebody's view. 
 Comparative reading actually is nothing new. 
 It's a standard practice in the academic world. 
 There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature. 
 Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic. 
 So I thought, well, if comparative reading works for research, why not do it in daily life too? 
 So I started reading books in pairs. 
 So they can be about people -- ["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] -- who are involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences. 
 ["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder] I also compare the same stories in different genres -- [Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] -- or similar stories from different cultures, as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell] For example, both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations. 
 For the Christ, the temptations are economic, political and spiritual. 
 For the Buddha, they are all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting. 
 So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages. 
 ["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts] Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain. 
 For example, it's through translation that I realized "happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh! 
 "Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh. 
 Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present. 
 I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again. 
 Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered. 
 I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. 
 Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from. 
 Even a shattered dream can do that for you. 
 So because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity, most of the time. 
 So may books be always with you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impressive, as the new girl always seems to be. 
 She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case, super strong on state capitals, just a great speller. 
 And I just curdled with jealousy that year, until I hatched my devious plan. 
 So one day I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom. 
 When the coast was clear, I emerged, crept into the classroom, and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. 
 And then I did it. 
 I fiddled with my rival's grades, just a little, just demoted some of those A's. 
 All of those A's. 
 And I got ready to return the book to the drawer, when hang on, some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. 
 So, in a frenzy, I corrected everybody's marks, not imaginatively. 
 I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's, just because I was there, you know, might as well. 
 And I am still baffled by my behavior. 
 I don't understand where the idea came from. 
 I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. 
 I felt great. 
 I don't understand why I was never caught. 
 I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious. 
 I was never caught. 
 But most of all, I am baffled by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at spelling? 
 Jealousy baffles me. 
 It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive. 
 We know babies suffer from jealousy. 
 We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone. 
 We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. 
 And yet, I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. 
 For that, we have to go to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. 
 In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy, would we even have literature? 
 Well no faithless Helen, no "Odyssey." 
 No jealous king, no "Arabian Nights." 
 No Shakespeare. 
 There goes high school reading lists, because we're losing "Sound and the Fury," we're losing "Gatsby," "Sun Also Rises," we're losing "Madame Bovary," "Anna K." 
 No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean, I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything, but in the case of jealousy, he kind of does. 
 This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time," and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have. 
 And we think about Proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right? 
 We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. 
 We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. 
 We forget how harsh his vision was. 
 We forget how pitiless he is. 
 I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut. 
 I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable. 
 Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust. 
 Is it something as obvious as that jealousy, which boils down into person, desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation? 
 I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. 
 When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story. 
 We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. 
 As the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. Right? 
 Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something Proust understood. 
 In the first volume, Swann's Way, the series of books, Swann, one of the main characters, is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences, and these are Proustian sentences, so they're long as rivers, but in the course of a few sentences, he suddenly recoils and he realizes, "Hang on, everything I love about this woman, somebody else would love about this woman. 
 Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure, maybe right about now." 
 And this is the story he starts to tell himself, and from then on, Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress, he adds to his "collection of instruments in his private torture chamber." 
 Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit, were notoriously jealous. 
 You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. 
 But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right? 
 Jealousy is exhausting. 
 It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed. 
 And what does jealousy like? 
 Jealousy likes information. 
 Jealousy likes details. 
 Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case. 
 Jealousy likes photos. 
 That's why Instagram is such a hit. 
 Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. 
 When Swann is in his jealous throes, and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants, he defends these behaviors. 
 He says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant, but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument." 
 He says, "They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value." 
 Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better. 
 Grief, humiliation, loss: These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust. 
 He says, "A woman whom we need, who makes us suffer, elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us." 
 Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women? 
 No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. 
 And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way? 
 Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement? 
 Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity? 
 Freud would write about this later. 
 One day, Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. 
 And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy, because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. 
 Because she's blameless; everybody knows it. 
 The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. 
 But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing, unintentional behaviors. 
 Is she smiling too brightly here, or did she accidentally brush up against a man there? 
 [Freud] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious. 
 The novel is very good on this point. 
 The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. 
 In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy. 
 And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. 
 Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. 
 Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news. 
 A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself for a year. 
 For a year. A year. 
 And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, and I have to confess when I heard this, I just reacted with admiration. 
 Because, I mean, let's be real. 
 What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right? 
 This is something from a novel. 
 This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel. 
 Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. 
 She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters. 
 She's the author of "Strangers on a Train" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley," books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. 
 Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character. 
 Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had, and you're under the floorboards, he's answering to your name, he's wearing your rings, emptying your bank account. 
 That's one way to go. 
 But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route. 
 I can't give the world D's, as much as I would really like to, some days. 
 And it's a pity, because we live in envious times. 
 We live in jealous times. 
 I mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we, where the currency is envy? 
 Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure. 
 So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possession of a mystery. 
 Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. 
 When people think of Holmes, they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty, right, this criminal mastermind. 
 But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade, who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately, needs Holmes' genius, but resents him. 
 Oh, it's so familiar to me. 
 So Lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. 
 But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons," once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution, Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says, "We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes. 
 We're proud of you." 
 And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand. 
 It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right? 
 It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion. 
 You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. 
 The next minute they're on the same side. 
 Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. 
 Could it be so simple though? 
 What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another? 
 Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. 
 We could align ourselves with it. 
 But I like contingency plans. 
 So while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. 
 Fiction alone demystifies jealousy. 
 Fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table. 
 And look who it gathers: sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley, crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself. 
 We are in excellent company. 
 Thank you. 
 I was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area in the northern part of New York State. 
 It was a beautiful day. 
 The forest was sparkling. 
 The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass, and if it weren't for the path we were following, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land. 
 We got to our campsite. 
 It was a lean-to on a bluff looking over a crystal, beautiful lake, when I discovered a horror. 
 Behind the lean-to was a dump, maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil, and a dead sneaker. 
 And I was astonished, I was very angry, and I was deeply confused. 
 The campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in, who did they think would clean up after them? 
 That question stayed with me, and it simplified a little. 
 Who cleans up after us? 
 However you configure or wherever you place the us, who cleans up after us in Istanbul? 
 Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London? 
 Here in New York, the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us, to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day. 
 I wanted to get to know them as individuals. 
 I wanted to understand who takes the job. 
 What's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden? 
 So I started a research project with them. 
 I rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city, and I learned a lot, but I was still an outsider. 
 I needed to go deeper. 
 So I took the job as a sanitation worker. 
 I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks. 
 And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow. 
 It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education. 
 Everyone asks about the smell. 
 It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and on days when it is really bad, you get used to it rather quickly. 
 The weight takes a long time to get used to. 
 I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week. 
 Then there's the danger. 
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country, and I learned why. 
 You're in and out of traffic all day, and it's zooming around you. 
 It just wants to get past you, so it's often the motorist is not paying attention. 
 That's really bad for the worker. 
 And then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm. 
 I also learned about the relentlessness of trash. 
 When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck, you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself. 
 It never stops coming. 
 It's also like a form of respiration or circulation. 
 It must always be in motion. 
 And then there's the stigma. 
 You put on the uniform, and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck, or you're taking a break too close to their home, or you're drinking coffee in their diner, and they will come and scorn you, and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them. 
 I find the stigma especially ironic, because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city, for three reasons. 
 They are the first guardians of public health. 
 If they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day, it starts to spill out of its containments, and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways. 
 Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us. 
 The economy needs them. 
 If we can't throw out the old stuff, we have no room for the new stuff, so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised. 
 I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship. 
 And then there's what I call our average, necessary quotidian velocity. 
 By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age. 
 We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around our coffee cup, our shopping bag, our bottle of water. 
 We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them, because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away. 
 So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane. 
 Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical. 
 They're on the streets every day, rhythmically. 
 They wear a uniform in many cities. 
 You know when to expect them. 
 And their work lets us do our work. 
 They are almost a form of reassurance. 
 The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own dross, our cast-offs, and that flow must be maintained always no matter what. 
 On the day after September 11 in 2001, I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street, and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every Wednesday. 
 And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days, but I started to cry. 
 And he looked at me, and he just nodded, and he said, "We're going to be okay. 
 We're going to be okay." 
 It was a little while later that I started my research with sanitation, and I met that man again. 
 His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times, and we became good friends. 
 I want to believe that Paulie was right. 
 We are going to be okay. 
 But in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet, we must include and take account of all the costs, including the very real human cost of the labor. 
 And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about, how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling, which is a remarkable success across 40 years, across the United States and countries around the world, and lift us up to a broader horizon where we're looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources. 
 Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage, accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream. 
 It's a remarkable statistic. 
 So in the flow of your days, in the flow of your lives, next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them. 
 Take a moment to say thank you. 
 Hello, TEDWomen, what's up. 
 Not good enough. 
 Hello, TEDWomen, what is up? 
 My name is Maysoon Zayid, and I am not drunk, but the doctor who delivered me was. 
 He cut my mom six different times in six different directions, suffocating poor little me in the process. 
 As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which means I shake all the time. 
 Look. 
 It's exhausting. I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali. 
 C.P. is not genetic. 
 It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it. 
 No one put a curse on my mother's uterus, and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins, which they are. 
 It only happens from accidents, like what happened to me on my birth day. 
 Now, I must warn you, I'm not inspirational, and I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me, because at some point in your life, you have dreamt of being disabled. 
 Come on a journey with me. 
 It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall, you're driving around in circles looking for parking, and what do you see? 
 Sixteen empty handicapped spaces. 
 And you're like, "God, can't I just be a little disabled?" 
 Also, I gotta tell you, I got 99 problems, and palsy is just one. 
 If there was an Oppression Olympics, I would win the gold medal. 
 I'm Palestinian, Muslim, I'm female, I'm disabled, and I live in New Jersey. 
 If you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should. 
 Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown. 
 I have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials. 
 I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could. 
 A lot of people with C.P. don't walk, but my parents didn't believe in "can't." 
 My father's mantra was, "You can do it, yes you can can." 
 So, if my three older sisters were mopping, I was mopping. 
 If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too, and if we didn't all get A's, we all got my mother's slipper. 
 My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking. 
 Another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it. 
 My inner stripper was very strong, and by -- Yeah. No, by the first day of kindergarten, I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times. 
 Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my town, and they were all my family. 
 Now there are 20 Arabs in town, and they are still all my family. 
 I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian. 
 This was before 9/11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use "I hate Moslems" as a campaign slogan. 
 The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith. 
 They did, however, seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan. 
 I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months, so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake. 
 I have tap-danced on Broadway. 
 Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy. 
 My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dancing school. 
 I learned how to dance in heels, which means I can walk in heels. 
 And I'm from Jersey, and we are really concerned with being chic, so if my friends wore heels, so did I. 
 And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the Jersey Shore, I did not. 
 I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer, we'd grow up to be Madonna. 
 Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me, so I drank deer's milk, I had hot cups on my back, I was dunked in the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking, "It's working! It's working!" 
 But one miracle cure we did find was yoga. 
 I have to tell you, it's very boring, but before I did yoga, I was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up. 
 And now I can stand on my head. 
 My parents reinforced this notion that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera "General Hospital." 
 I went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to ASU, Arizona State University, because I fit every single quota. 
 I was like the pet lemur of the theater department. 
 Everybody loved me. 
 I did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework, I got A's in all of my classes, A's in all of their classes. 
 Every time I did a scene from "The Glass Menagerie," my professors would weep. 
 But I never got cast. 
 Finally, my senior year, ASU decided to do a show called "They Dance Real Slow in Jackson." 
 It's a play about a girl with C.P. 
 I was a girl with C.P. 
 So I start shouting from the rooftops, "I'm finally going to get a part! 
 I have cerebral palsy! 
 Free at last! Free at last! 
 Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!" 
 I didn't get the part. 
 Sherry Brown got the part. 
 I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically, like someone shot my cat, to ask her why, and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts. 
 I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts, neither can the character." 
 This was a part that I was literally born to play and they gave it, they gave it to a non-palsy actress. 
 College was imitating life. 
 Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen. 
 Upon graduating, I moved back home, and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera. 
 My dream was coming true. 
 And I knew that I would be promoted from "diner diner" to "wacky best friend" in no time. 
 But instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head, and it became clear to me that casting directors didn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors. 
 They only hired perfect people. 
 But there were exceptions to the rule. 
 I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr, Ellen, and all of these women had one thing in common: they were comedians. 
 So I became a comic. 
 My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike with a chick with C.P. driving him. 
 I've performed in clubs all over America, and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East, uncensored and uncovered. 
 Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world. 
 I never like to claim first, but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny, and they find us hysterical. 
 In 2003, my brother from another mother and father Dean Obeidallah and I started the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival, now in its 10th year. 
 Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media, while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous. 
 Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability. 
 My big break came in 2010. 
 I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show "Countdown With Keith Olbermann." 
 I walked in looking like I was going to the prom, and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair. 
 So I looked at the stage manager and I'm like, "Excuse me, can I have another chair?" 
 And she looked at me and she went, "Five, four, three, two ..." 
 And we were live, right? 
 So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment, and when the interview was over, I was livid. 
 I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it, and I knew I would never get invited back. 
 But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back, he made me a full-time contributor, and he taped down my chair. 
 One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann was that humans on the Internet are scumbags. 
 People say children are cruel, but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult. 
 Suddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game. 
 I would look at clips online and see comments like, "Yo, why's she tweakin?" 
 "Yo, is she retarded?" 
 And my favorite, "Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist. 
 What does she suffer from? 
 We should really pray for her." 
 One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits: screenwriter, comedian, palsy. 
 Disability is as visual as race. 
 If a wheelchair user can't play Beyonc√©, then Beyonc√© can't play a wheelchair user. 
 The disabled are the largest ‚Äî Yeah, clap for that, man. C'mon. 
 People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world, and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment. 
 The doctors said that I wouldn't walk, but I am here in front of you. 
 However, if I grew up with social media, I don't think I would be. 
 I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life. 
 Perhaps if there were more positive images, it would foster less hate on the Internet. 
 Or maybe not. 
 Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well. 
 My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places. 
 I got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci and the iconic Lorraine Arbus. 
 I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews. 
 I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild. 
 I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 DNC. 
 And I founded Maysoon's Kids, a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me. 
 But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got -- before this moment -- ‚Äî but the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, has Parkinson's and shakes just like me, Muhammad Ali. 
 It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live, and I dedicate this talk to his memory. 
 My name is Maysoon Zayid, and if I can can, you can can. 
 So, we used to solve big problems. 
 On July 21st, 1969, Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility. 
 Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the moon's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort. 
 The Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States. 
 To get to the moon, NASA spent around 180 billion dollars in today's money, or four percent of the federal budget. 
 Apollo employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies. 
 People died, including the crew of Apollo 1. 
 But before the Apollo program ended, 24 men flew to the moon. 
 Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin, following the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most senior. 
 So why did they go? 
 They didn't bring much back: 841 pounds of old rocks, and something all 24 later emphasized -- a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home. 
 Why did they go? The cynical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets. 
 But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962 provide a better clue. 
 To contemporaries, Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East in the Cold War. 
 At the time, the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology. 
 They went because it was a big thing to do. 
 Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs. 
 The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis. 
 In the middle years of the century, polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated. 
 Technology itself seemed to possess what Alvin Toffler in 1970 called "accelerative thrust." 
 For most of human history, we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 25,000 miles an hour. 
 Since 1970, no human beings have been back to the moon. 
 No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve, such as going to Mars, creating clean energy, curing cancer, or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard. 
 I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17. 
 I was five years old, and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket. 
 I vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions, but I was absolutely certain there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime. 
 So "Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology" has become a commonplace. 
 You hear it all the time. 
 We've heard it over the last two days here at TED. 
 It feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys, with things like iPhones and apps and social media, or algorithms that speed automated trading. 
 There's nothing wrong with most of these things. 
 They've expanded and enriched our lives. 
 But they don't solve humanity's big problems. 
 What happened? 
 So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley, which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech. 
 Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame, in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs. 
 Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems. 
 But I don't think that explanation is good enough. 
 It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley. 
 Even when venture capitalists were at their most risk-happy, they preferred small investments, tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years. 
 V.C.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy, and V.C.s have never, never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value. 
 No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound. 
 Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems. 
 We could go to Mars if we want. 
 NASA even has the outline of a plan. 
 But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal, and that will never happen. 
 We won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth. 
 Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because our political systems fail. 
 Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption derives from advanced, renewable sources such as solar, wind and biofuels, less than two percent, and the reason is purely economic. 
 Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels. 
 We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price. None exist. 
 Now, technologists, business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy: mostly, a significant increase in energy research and development, and some kind of price on carbon. 
 But there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus. 
 Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so. 
 Famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply. 
 But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution. 
 Technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food, but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments. 
 Finally, big problems sometimes elude solution because we don't really understand the problem. 
 President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer, most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy, and it is only in the last 10 years that effective, viable therapies have come to seem real. 
 Hard problems are hard. 
 It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology. 
 We can, we must, but these four elements must all be present: Political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem; institutions must support its solution; It must really be a technological problem; and we must understand it. 
 The Apollo mission, which has become a kind of metaphor for technology's capacity to solve big problems, met these criteria. 
 But it is an irreproducible model for the future. 
 It is not 1961. 
 There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War, no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous, and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system. 
 Most of all, going to the moon turned out to be easy. 
 It was just three days away. 
 And arguably it wasn't even solving much of a problem. 
 We are left alone with our day, and the solutions of the future will be harder won. 
 God knows, we don't lack for the challenges. 
 Thank you very much. 
 I'd like to invite you to close your eyes. 
 Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home. 
 I'd like you to notice the color of the door, the material that it's made out of. 
 Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles. 
 They are competing in a naked bicycle race, and they are headed straight for your front door. 
 I need you to actually see this. 
 They are pedaling really hard, they're sweaty, they're bouncing around a lot. 
 And they crash straight into the front door of your home. 
 Bicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you, spokes end up in awkward places. 
 Step over the threshold of your door into your foyer, your hallway, whatever's on the other side, and appreciate the quality of the light. 
 The light is shining down on Cookie Monster. 
 Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse. 
 It's a talking horse. 
 You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose. 
 You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth. 
 Walk past him. Walk past him into your living room. 
 In your living room, in full imaginative broadband, picture Britney Spears. 
 She is scantily clad, she's dancing on your coffee table, and she's singing "Hit Me Baby One More Time." 
 And then follow me into your kitchen. 
 In your kitchen, the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road and out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Lion from "The Wizard of Oz," hand-in-hand skipping straight towards you. 
 Okay. Open your eyes. 
 I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in New York City. 
 It's called the United States Memory Championship. 
 And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist expecting, I guess, that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants. 
 This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies, widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep. 
 They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once. 
 They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers. 
 They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes. 
 They were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest. 
 I was like, this is unbelievable. 
 These people must be freaks of nature. 
 And I started talking to a few of the competitors. 
 This is a guy called Ed Cook who had come over from England where he had one of the best trained memories. 
 And I said to him, "Ed, when did you realize that you were a savant?" 
 And Ed was like, "I'm not a savant. 
 In fact, I have just an average memory. 
 Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory. 
 We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques, techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches, that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books." 
 And I was like, "Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?" 
 And we were standing outside the competition hall, and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric English guy, says to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist. 
 Do you know Britney Spears?" 
 I'm like, "What? No. Why?" 
 "Because I really want to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on U.S. national television. 
 It will prove to the world that anybody can do this." 
 I was like, "Well I'm not Britney Spears, but maybe you could teach me. 
 I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?" 
 And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me. 
 I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory, but also investigating it, trying to understand how it works, why it sometimes doesn't work and what its potential might be. 
 I met a host of really interesting people. 
 This is a guy called E.P. 
 He's an amnesic who had, very possibly, the very worst memory in the world. 
 His memory was so bad that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem, which is amazing. 
 And he was this incredibly tragic figure, but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are. 
 The other end of the spectrum: I met this guy. 
 This is Kim Peek. 
 He was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie "Rain Man." 
 We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library memorizing phone books, which was scintillating. 
 And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises, treatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin in Antiquity and then later in the Middle Ages. 
 And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff. 
 One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time, this idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today. 
 Once upon a time, people invested in their memories, in laboriously furnishing their minds. 
 Over the last few millenia we've invented a series of technologies -- from the alphabet to the scroll to the codex, the printing press, photography, the computer, the smartphone -- that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories, for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity. 
 These technologies have made our modern world possible, but they've also changed us. 
 They've changed us culturally, and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively. 
 Having little need to remember anymore, it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how. 
 One of the last places on Earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory is at this totally singular memory contest. 
 It's actually not that singular, there are contests held all over the world. 
 And I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it. 
 A few years back a group of researchers at University College London brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab. 
 They wanted to know: Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally, anatomically different from the rest of ours? 
 The answer was no. 
 Are they smarter than the rest of us? 
 They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was not really. 
 There was however one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to. 
 When they put these guys in an fMRI machine, scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes, they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else. 
 Of note, they were using, or they seemed to be using, a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation. 
 Why? And is there something the rest of us can learn from this? 
 The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly, and then the rest of the field has to play catchup. 
 This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three-time world memory champion. 
 On his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards that he is about to try to memorize in one hour, using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered. 
 He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits in half an hour. 
 Yeah. 
 And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions, everything, all of the techniques that are being used, ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding. 
 And it's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the Baker/baker paradox, which goes like this: If I tell two people to remember the same word, if I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy named Baker." 
 That's his name. 
 And I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker." 
 And I come back to you at some point later on, and I say, "Do you remember that word that I told you a while back? 
 Do you remember what it was?" 
 The person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is that he is a baker. 
 Same word, different amount of remembering; that's weird. 
 What's going on here? 
 Well the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you. 
 It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull. 
 But the common noun baker, we know bakers. 
 Bakers wear funny white hats. 
 Bakers have flour on their hands. 
 Bakers smell good when they come home from work. 
 Maybe we even know a baker. 
 And when we first hear that word, we start putting these associational hooks into it that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date. 
 The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers into lower-case B bakers -- to take information that is lacking in context, in significance, in meaning and transform it in some way so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind. 
 One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece. 
 It came to be known as the memory palace. 
 The story behind its creation goes like this: There was a poet called Simonides who was attending a banquet. 
 He was actually the hired entertainment, because back then if you wanted to throw a really slamming party, you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet. 
 And he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door, and at the moment he does, the banquet hall collapses, kills everybody inside. 
 It doesn't just kill everybody, it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition. 
 Nobody can say who was inside, nobody can say where they were sitting. 
 The bodies can't be properly buried. 
 It's one tragedy compounding another. 
 Simonides, standing outside, the sole survivor amid the wreckage, closes his eyes and has this realization, which is that in his mind's eye, he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting. 
 And he takes the relatives by the hand and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage. 
 What Simonides figured out at that moment is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know, which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues, we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories. 
 If I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Simonides, chances are you would have a tough time with it. 
 But I would wager that if I asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your foyer right now, you would be able to see that. 
 The idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the crazier, weirder, more bizarre, funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is, the more unforgettable it's likely to be. 
 This is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years to the earliest Latin memory treatises. 
 So how does this work? 
 Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory, and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it if he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago. 
 What you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house. 
 And you'd come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest. 
 And then you'd go inside your house, and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed. 
 And that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook. 
 And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell. 
 And you go into your kitchen, and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year, and you have some friends to help you remember that. 
 This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches -- not word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up, but topic-for-topic. 
 In fact, the phrase "topic sentence," that comes from the Greek word "topos," which means "place." 
 That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms. 
 The phrase "in the first place," that's like in the first place of your memory palace. 
 I thought this was just fascinating, and I got really into it. 
 And I went to a few more of these memory contests. 
 And I had this notion that I might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers. 
 But there was a problem. 
 The problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event. 
 Truly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs. 
 I mean, the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples. 
 And I'm a journalist, I need something to write about. 
 I know that there's this incredible stuff happening in these people's minds, but I don't have access to it. 
 And I realized, if I was going to tell this story, I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit. 
 And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sat down with my New York Times just trying to remember something. 
 Maybe it was a poem. 
 Maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market. 
 And I found that this was shockingly fun. 
 I never would have expected that. 
 It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory. 
 What you're doing is you're trying to get better and better and better at creating, at dreaming up, these utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye. 
 And I got pretty into it. 
 This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit. 
 It's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes, because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy. 
 I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier. 
 And I had this notion that I might enter it, sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism. 
 It'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research. 
 Problem was the experiment went haywire. 
 I won the contest, which really wasn't supposed to happen. 
 Now it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists, but it's actually kind of beside the point. 
 These are just tricks. 
 They are tricks that work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work. 
 And you don't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works. 
 We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift, but that is not the case. 
 Great memories are learned. 
 At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention. 
 We remember when we are deeply engaged. 
 We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience and figure out why it is meaningful to us, why it is significant, why it's colorful, when we're able to transform it in some way that it makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds, when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers. 
 The memory palace, these memory techniques, they're just shortcuts. 
 In fact, they're not even really shortcuts. 
 They work because they make you work. 
 They force a kind of depth of processing, a kind of mindfulness, that most of us don't normally walk around exercising. 
 But there actually are no shortcuts. 
 This is how stuff is made memorable. 
 And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with, it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't even remember that he had a memory problem, left me with, which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories. 
 How much are we willing to lose from our already short lives by losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones, by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us, by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply? 
 I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us. 
 But if you want to live a memorable life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember. 
 Thank you. 
 When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding: teaching. 
 I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. 
 And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests. 
 I gave out homework assignments. 
 When the work came back, I calculated grades. 
 What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. 
 Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric I.Q. scores. 
 Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. 
 And that got me thinking. 
 The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram. 
 But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. 
 After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. 
 In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is I.Q., but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily? 
 So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. 
 I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why? 
 My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. 
 We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. 
 We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. 
 We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students? 
 We partnered with private companies, asking, which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs? 
 And who's going to earn the most money? 
 In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. 
 And it wasn't social intelligence. 
 It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't I.Q. 
 It was grit. 
 Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. 
 Grit is having stamina. 
 Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. 
 Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. 
 A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. 
 I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. 
 Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school. 
 So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out. 
 To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it. 
 Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I build grit in kids? 
 What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic? 
 How do I keep them motivated for the long run?" 
 The honest answer is, I don't know. 
 What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. 
 Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. 
 In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. 
 So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called "growth mindset." 
 This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. 
 Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. 
 So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. 
 But we need more. 
 And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are. 
 That's the work that stands before us. 
 We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. 
 We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. 
 In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. 
 Thank you. 
 My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions. 
 Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this. 
 Both projects are in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia. 
 And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture. 
 The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa. 
 And this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and myself, of what we had to design. 
 At first, the first thing I thought was, I want to run away. 
 After seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big points. 
 First, these buildings, they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things. 
 Second, they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside, and then you need a lot of cooling. 
 In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year. 
 And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia. 
 It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions. 
 Also during our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open-air structure where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day from small vendors. 
 And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity. 
 So I thought, this is what I really want to design, not a shopping mall. 
 But the question was how we could do a multistory, contemporary building with these principles. 
 The next challenge was when we looked at the site, that is, in a really growing area of the city, where most of these buildings that you see in the image, they were not there. 
 And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters. 
 So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entrances of the building. 
 And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain. 
 And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops, that change in each floor because of the shape of the void. 
 I also thought, how to close the building? 
 And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions. 
 And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in, and also the light, but in a filtered way. 
 And then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the Ethiopian women's dresses. 
 That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade. 
 And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building. 
 And this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night. 
 With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like, "This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that." 
 But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell. 
 And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper, not only because of the material compared with the glass, but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore. 
 So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project. 
 And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day. 
 So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof. 
 And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis. 
 And these porches on the roof, all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside. 
 Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction. 
 The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis. 
 And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed, I really needed to understand the city of Tunis, but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture. 
 During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall, opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines. 
 When I went to the site, the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards. 
 On top of that, we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines, and this modified this initial pattern. 
 And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan. 
 And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment? 
 And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation. 
 So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction. 
 And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city. 
 It has these blocks with courtyards, and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians. 
 And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor. 
 And it also reinforces this idea of the gates. 
 The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities, such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor. 
 The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction. 
 And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize, and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning, jumping from one building to another. 
 These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process. 
 And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing. 
 In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow. 
 For this reason, I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people. 
 Thank you very much. 
 So I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust. 
 I think these are so commonplace, they've become clich√©s of our society. 
 And I think there are three. 
 One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust, very widely believed. 
 The second is an aim: we should have more trust. 
 And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust. 
 I think that the claim, the aim and the task are all misconceived. 
 So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter. 
 First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined? 
 And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer. 
 I'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others. 
 I don't have an overview. 
 But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls, and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined. 
 When you actually look at opinion polls across time, there's not much evidence for that. 
 That's to say, the people who were mistrusted 20 years ago, principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted. 
 And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses. 
 The rest of us are in between, and by the way, the average person in the street is almost exactly midway. 
 But is that good evidence? 
 What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions. 
 What else can they record? 
 So they're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions. 
 Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers? 
 Now if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers? 
 Do you trust fishmongers? 
 Do you trust elementary school teachers?" 
 you would probably begin by saying, "To do what?" 
 And that would be a perfectly sensible response. 
 And you might say, when you understood the answer to that, "Well, I trust some of them, but not others." 
 That's a perfectly rational thing. 
 In short, in our real lives, we seek to place trust in a differentiated way. 
 We don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office-holder or type of person is going to be uniform. 
 I might, for example, say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the reception class to read, but in no way to drive the school minibus. 
 I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver. 
 I might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret. 
 Simple. 
 So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated, why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly? 
 I think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists, because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust. 
 Secondly, what about the aim? 
 The aim is to have more trust. 
 Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim. 
 It's not what I would aim at. 
 I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy. 
 In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy. 
 And I think, of those people who, for example, placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff, who then made off with them, and I think of them, and I think, well, yes, too much trust. 
 More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life. 
 Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim. 
 Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness. 
 It's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects. 
 And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things. 
 Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable? 
 And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters, and reliable and honest, we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them, because they'll be trustworthy. 
 But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not. 
 I have friends who are competent and honest, but I would not trust them to post a letter, because they're forgetful. 
 I have friends who are very confident they can do certain things, but I realize that they overestimate their own competence. 
 And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest. 
 If so, I haven't yet spotted it. 
 But that's what we're looking for: trustworthiness before trust. 
 Trust is the response. 
 Trustworthiness is what we have to judge. And, of course, it's difficult. 
 Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness. 
 A lot of these systems have the converse effect. 
 They don't work as they're supposed to. 
 I remember I was talking with a midwife who said, "Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby." 
 And all over our public life, our institutional life, we find that problem, that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite. 
 It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks, like midwives, from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say. 
 You can all give your own examples there. 
 So so much for the aim. 
 The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness, and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people, and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy. 
 It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction, attitudes, don't do adequately here. 
 Now thirdly, the task. 
 Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think, also gets things backwards. 
 It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust. 
 Well, we can do that for ourselves. 
 We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness. 
 We can do it two people together trying to improve trust. 
 But trust, in the end, is distinctive because it's given by other people. 
 You can't rebuild what other people give you. 
 You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust. 
 So you have to, I think, be trustworthy. 
 And that, of course, is because you can't fool all of the people all of the time, usually. 
 But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy. 
 How to do it? 
 Well every day, all over the place, it's being done by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions, quite effectively. 
 Let me give you a simple commercial example. 
 The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back, and they don't ask any questions. 
 They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted. 
 That's super. I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me. 
 I think there's a big lesson in that. 
 If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party, then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying. 
 So in the end, I think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern. 
 It is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy. 
 So the moral of all this is, we need to think much less about trust, let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis-detected by opinion polls, much more about being trustworthy, and how you give people adequate, useful and simple evidence that you're trustworthy. 
 Thanks. 
 You know, my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch. 
 I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids, and when my daughter was four, we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together. 
 It totally dominated her imagination for months. 
 Her favorite character was Glinda, of course. 
 It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand. 
 But you watch that movie enough times, and you start to realize how unusual it is. 
 Now we live today, and are raising our children, in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex. 
 But "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone. 
 It did not start that trend. 
 Forty years later was when the trend really caught on, with, interestingly, another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards. 
 Do you know what I'm talking about? 
 Yeah. 
 Now, there's a big difference between these two movies, a couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz" and all the movies we watch today. 
 One is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz." 
 The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees. 
 But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today, the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold. 
 Use your magic slippers to defeat the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch." 
 But that's not how it happens. 
 Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz" to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female. 
 Now I started to notice this when I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter, which was years later, and the situation was different. 
 At that point I also had a son. 
 He was only three at the time. 
 He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that. 
 But he was the second child, and the level of supervision had plummeted. 
 So he wandered in, and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling, and I don't think he understands what's going on, but he is sure soaking in it. 
 And I wonder what he's soaking in. 
 Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty? 
 Is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government? 
 Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess, who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe, which he does by the magic that he was born with? 
 Compare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz." 
 How does Dorothy win her movie? 
 By making friends with everybody and being a leader. 
 That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in -- Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting, which is where we kind of have to be. 
 Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force -- in the movies we have for our kids, and so little yellow brick road? 
 There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy-violent movie has on girls, and you should do that reading. It's very good. 
 I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe. 
 I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co-ed. 
 I think there was a first-kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie, right? 
 I finished my quest, I got the girl. 
 Why are you still standing there? 
 I don't know what I'm supposed to do. 
 The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys. 
 It's almost as though if you're a boy, you are a dopey animal, and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume. 
 There are plenty of exceptions, and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you. 
 But they do send a message to boys, that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience. 
 They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy, but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy. 
 There's no models for them. 
 And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids, and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are, these are still war movies. 
 And, of course, the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic, every single one of them about the journey of a boy, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a little girl. 
 Until, as many of you are thinking, this year, when they finally came out with "Brave." 
 I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now. 
 Do you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out? 
 "Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie." 
 It's very good. Don't let that stop you. 
 Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test. 
 I don't know if you've heard of this. 
 It has not yet caught on and caught fire, but maybe today we will start a movement. 
 Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist, and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw. 
 And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask: Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines? 
 So try to meet that bar. 
 And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie? 
 And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like? 
 Right? Thank you. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff. 
 It does happen. I've seen it, and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love. 
 In fact, this week I went to see a very high-quality movie, "Argo." 
 Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office, a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is. 
 It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test. 
 And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis. 
 We've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout, and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?" 
 That's Hollywood for you. 
 So let's look at the numbers. 
 2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists? 
 Eleven. It's not bad. 
 It's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to Congress, so that's good. 
 But there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down. 
 Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done. 
 Here's what it said. 
 One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life. 
 Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment. 
 I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that. 
 I don't even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that, but something is going wrong, and when I hear that statistic, one of the things I think of is that's a lot of sexual assailants. 
 Who are these guys? What are they learning? 
 What are they failing to learn? 
 Are they absorbing the story that a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak? 
 Are we soaking up that story? 
 You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them. 
 We have tools at our disposal like "girl power," and we hope that that will help, but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them if, at the same time, actively or passively, we are training our sons to maintain their boy power? 
 I mean, I think the Netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important, and I'm talking mainly to the dads here. 
 I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood. 
 The definition of manhood is already turning upside down. 
 You've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner. 
 They're throwing it up in the air. 
 So our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other, and I think we really have to show them, and model for them, how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them, and wants to be on their team, and stands up against the real bad guys, who are the men who want to abuse the women. 
 And I think our job in the Netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test, if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines who are there, who show real courage, who bring people together, and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say, "I want to be on their team," because they're going to be on their team. 
 When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars," do you know what she said? 
 Obi-Wan. 
 Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda. 
 What do these two have in common? 
 Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress. 
 I think these people are experts. 
 I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else, and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential. 
 Now, they are leaders. 
 I like that kind of quest for my daughter, and I like that kind of quest for my son. 
 I want more quests like that. 
 I want fewer quests where my son is told, "Go out and fight it alone," and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people become better and be better people, like the Wizard of Oz. 
 Thank you. 
 I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid. 
 I don't know his name, but I do know his story. 
 He lives in a small village in southern Somalia. 
 His village is near Mogadishu. 
 Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation. 
 With nothing left for him there, he leaves for the big city, in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. 
 When he arrives, there are no opportunities, no jobs, no way forward. 
 He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu. 
 Maybe a year passes, nothing. 
 One day, he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch, then to dinner, to breakfast. 
 He meets this dynamic group of people, and they give him a break. 
 He's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes, money to send back home to his family. 
 He is introduced to this young woman. 
 He eventually gets married. 
 He starts this new life. 
 He has a purpose in life. 
 One beautiful day in Mogadishu, under an azure blue sky, a car bomb goes off. 
 That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber, and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda. 
 So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up? 
 He was waiting. 
 He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to begin his future, waiting for a way forward, and this was the first thing that came along. 
 This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood. 
 And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world. 
 It is the story of the disenfranchised, unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg, sparks riots in London, who reaches out for something other than waithood. 
 For young people, the promise of the city, the big city dream is that of opportunity, of jobs, of wealth, but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities. 
 Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates. 
 By 2030, three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18. 
 If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities, if we do not provide them opportunities, the story of waithood, the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs, will be the story of cities 2.0. 
 And in my city of birth, Mogadishu, 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment. 
 70 percent don't work, don't go to school. 
 They pretty much do nothing. 
 I went back to Mogadishu last month, and I went to visit Madina Hospital, the hospital I was born in. 
 I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking, what if I had never left? 
 What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood? 
 Would I have become a terrorist? 
 I'm not really sure about the answer. 
 My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit. 
 I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders. 
 We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city. 
 One of the young men in the room was Aden. 
 He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated. 
 There were no jobs, no opportunities. 
 I remember him telling me, because he was a college graduate, unemployed, frustrated, that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited. 
 They sought people like him out. 
 But his story takes a different route. 
 In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads. 
 Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around. 
 Aden saw an opportunity and seized it. 
 He started a motorbike company. 
 He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them. 
 He bought 10 bikes, with the help of family and friends, and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years. 
 How is this story different? 
 What makes his story different? 
 I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity. 
 It's entrepreneurship, and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood. 
 It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking. 
 And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs. 
 I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist. 
 He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship. 
 He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came along, if you wanted flowers at your wedding, you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad. 
 If you asked someone, "When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?" for many who grew up under civil war, the answer would be, "Never." 
 So Mohamed saw an opportunity. 
 He started a landscaping and design floral company. 
 He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu, and started growing tulips and lilies, which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate. 
 And he began delivering flowers to weddings, creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city, and he's now working on creating Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years. 
 There's no public park in Mogadishu. 
 He wants to create a space where families, young people, can come together, and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses. 
 And he doesn't grow roses because they use too much water, by the way. 
 So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room. 
 They had never really thought about starting up a business. 
 They've thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but his story, his innovation, really had a strong impact on them. 
 He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity. 
 He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be change makers. 
 By the end of the day, they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city. 
 They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems. 
 So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality. 
 They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses. 
 Connect young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation, and you will create catalysts for urban growth. 
 For me, entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business. 
 It's about creating a social impact. 
 Mohamed is not simply selling flowers. 
 I believe he is selling hope. 
 His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it, when it's created, will actually transform the way people see their city. 
 Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him. 
 He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood. 
 These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities. 
 So my suggestion is, turn youth into entrepreneurs, incubate and nurture their inherent innovation, and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood. 
 Thank you. 
 When I was a child growing up in Maine, one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine, because my parents told me it would bring me luck. 
 But you know, these shells, they're hard to find. 
 They're covered in sand. They're difficult to see. 
 However, overtime, I got used to looking for them. 
 I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them. 
 This grew into a passion for finding things, a love for the past and archaeology. 
 And eventually when I started studying Egyptology, I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough. 
 Because all of the sudden in Egypt my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long next to the Nile, and my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities. 
 This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery. 
 For trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently. 
 So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared. 
 This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Bendix. 
 And the site visibly appears brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it, all of the sudden, using false color, the site appears as bright pink. 
 What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians. 
 What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Itjtawy, missing for thousands of years. 
 Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom about four thousand years ago. 
 The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt and site is really important because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion. 
 Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere within this massive flood plane. 
 This area is huge -- it's four miles by three miles in size. 
 The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy, and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east, it covered over the city. 
 So, how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape? 
 Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack, blindfolded wearing baseball mitts. 
 So what we did is we used NASA topography data to map out the landscape, very subtle changes. 
 We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow. 
 But you can see in more detail -- and even more interesting -- this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here, which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy. 
 So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists to do coring work, which you see here. 
 When I say coring, it's like ice coring, but instead of layers of climate change you're looking for layers of human occupation. 
 And five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of pottery. 
 What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy, five meters down, we have of layer of occupation for several hundred years dating to the Middle Kingdom, dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is. 
 We also found work stone -- carnelian, quartz and agate that shows that there was a jewelers workshop here. 
 These might not look like much, but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom, these are the stones that were used. 
 So, we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site. 
 We also have evidence of an elite jewelers workshop, showing that whatever was there was a very important city. 
 No Itjtawy was here yet, but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out. 
 And even more importantly, we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well. 
 So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -- it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago. 
 "Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings. 
 There's nothing like it in the land." 
 So as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD. 
 Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC at a not-lost-for-long city, found from above. 
 It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Thank you.
